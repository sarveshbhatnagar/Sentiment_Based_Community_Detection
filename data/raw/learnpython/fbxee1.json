The problem is that the forecast is just resetting already made datapoints so for example:  \n  \n29 january is the last data point and the forecast is supposed to be for three days, now it starts the forecast on the 27th and ends on the 29th despite already having that data. I want the forecast to start at 30 january.  \n  \nAnyone got a clue how to fix this?  \n  \nThanks in advance!", "comments": []}
