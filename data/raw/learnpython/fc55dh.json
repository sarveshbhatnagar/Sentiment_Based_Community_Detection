So since I have such a long break, I thought working on a project over the break, with the goal of finishing it when it ends, might be a good way to spend the extra free time I have. \n\nI am currently learning the pandas module through youtube, so I was wondering if a good use of my time to learn might be downloading a sports dataset and trying to do some regression analysis or something with it?\n\nI had the idea of getting a NFL dataset and using python to clean the data and try to create a \"QB-Yards-Above-Replacement\" type statistic from the model or something.\n\nJust curious if manipulating a data set like that is a good idea or if I would learn more from some other type of project.", "comments": [{"id": "fj8nani", "author": "xtthew", "body": "You learn best working with something that you enjoy.
