For now i just want to create a password encrypter, and a random music reader. But, where should i start ? \n\nThere are tons of websites, videos, courses exercices, books here on the internet, that i don't even know where i should go... I though first reading a book on the internet might be a good way to start, then i would practice. Do you have any recommandations ?", "comments": [{"id": "fj734sg", "author": "sme272", "body": "read the wiki, pick a resource you like the look of and dive in."}, {"id": "fj73h7a", "author": "MicroPanda123", "body": "When i was starting i was just trying to realise that project, when i didn't know how to do something, i just googled it, for pasword encryptor you firstly need to know how to input that password, then how to encrypt it, then how to print it. You search for how to do all of this and write (don't just copy it!) it. Then test if works, if it doesn't work debug it by doing the same think and you do that until you are done with project. And for basically all of you project do a ladder of progress, you start on the top and then yoy need to establish what you need to do to make your project work.\nTL:DR Google if you don't know how to do some stuff, and before statrting establish what steps you need to make your project work. Thats how i started."}]}
