It won't re ask for me to enter a number. When I enter -1, program says \"goodbye!\" and exits. \n\nHow can I incorporate loops to ask user to keep asking for a number until this condition is met?\n\n\\[sample\\]\n\n    Enter a #: 5\n    5 is a fibo number\n    Enter a #: -1 \n    Goodbye! :) \n\nI hope this makes sense.

When/if you import the program into another script you know you can run the whole program by calling main, or call individual functions.
