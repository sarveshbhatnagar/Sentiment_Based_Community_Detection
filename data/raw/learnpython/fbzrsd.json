Ideally cross platform, but OS specific works. Primarily interested in Windows with secondary for Linux.\n\nAlso separate for Audio and Video would be good.\n\nThe context is that I'm trying to make a script that will be able to reliably tell if PC is idle or not, and playing video should be considered as not idle. Music I'm not sure yet, so optional. I curently use  \n\nwin32api.GetLastInputInfo() which is great, but does not work when you are watching a video or something.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAlso cant just check if a process is running, because of so many players and stuff like youtube, netflix and lots of other ways that a video can be played.", "comments": [{"id": "fj82c9m", "author": "sme272", "body": "You could look into the [Windows Audio Session API](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/coreaudio/wasapi) and see if you can find a way to detect all active audio streams."}]}
