{"id": "fc379d", "title": "ValueError: attempted relative import beyond top-level package with a grandparent directory", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython/comments/fc379d/valueerror_attempted_relative_import_beyond/", "subreddit": "learnpython", "author": "t2_1202v3", "text": "I am in the file \"Query.py\" trying to import the class SqlQuery from the file \"database.py\" which is located up two levels & then down one in another directory (also called \"database\"). Then the import statement I expect to work looks like this: \n\n    from ...database.database import SqlQuery\n\nBut that gives me:\n\n    Traceback (most recent call last):\n      File \"C:/Users/Roland/dir1/2020/Indeed-Scraper/scraper/classes/Query.py\", line 16, in <module>\n        from ....database.database import SqlQuery\n    ValueError: attempted relative import beyond top-level package\n\n*since I understand way you run the file can be important*, I am trying to run Query.py using my PyCharm IDE\n\nThis is way harder than I expected it to be!\n\nHere are the relevant parts of my file structure:\n\n    project_name/     \n        __init__.py     \n        database/         \n            __init__.py         \n            database.py     \n        scraper/         \n            classes/             \n                __init__.py             \n                Query.py\n\nI did Google & check out various StackOverflow threads about this. I either didn't find a satisfactory answer (I can't believe I need to write\n\n    sys.path.append(anything)\n\nin the best solution) or I didn't understand a solution when I found it.\n\nhere are the various things I've tried: (this code sits at the top of Query.py, one line above the from ...database.database import SqlQuerystatement)\n\n    import sys \n    sys.path.append(os.path.realpath('...')) # attempt 1 \n    sys.path.insert(0, '') # attempt 2 \n    sys.path.append(\"...\") # attempt 3 - I think it is strange that adding \"...\" to the path did not work?\n\nWhat do I do gang?
