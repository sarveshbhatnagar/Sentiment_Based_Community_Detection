That's more useful if your code is going to offered as a module. A hangover from C/Java programming. Put the main logic where you've called `main()`.\n\nI think you need to spend more time with pen and paper drawing the high level solution rather than working at the keyboard. Then write that up as pseudocode.\n\nSome ideas:\n\n    welcome()\n    order = []\n    while True:  # choosing from menu\n        option = menu_pick()\n        if not option:  # empty response to finish\n            break\n        toppings = []\n        if option in pizzas:\n            toppings = pizza_toppings(option)\n        order.append((options, toppings))\n    if order:\n        paid = take_payment(order)\n        if paid:\n            completed = make_order(order)\n        \n        etc"}]}
