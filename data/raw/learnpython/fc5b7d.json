Is there a way to make that text case sensitive? Or at least or in lower case?\n\nHere's the text replacing part of my code:\n\n    FromTo = {\"Q1\":\"Question 1\",\n              \"Q2\":\"Question 2\",\n              \"Q3\":\"Question 3\",\n              \"Q4\":\"Question 4\"}", "comments": [{"id": "fj8n4ug", "author": "xtthew", "body": "That's just code to make a dictionary.. and I'm not sure what you're trying to get at.. \n\nBut, have you tried using the string.lower() function?"}]}
