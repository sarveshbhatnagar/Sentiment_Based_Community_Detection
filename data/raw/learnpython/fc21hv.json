(I'm not passing much arguments to it as I don't know very much what I'm doing on it, so I'm simply using the  pytesseract.image\\_to\\_data function)\n\nThe image after the preprocessing: [https://ibb.co/vhkWwkq](https://ibb.co/vhkWwkq).\n\nShould this image get better results or I must improve the preprocessing?  \nThanks a lot for the help guys.", "comments": [{"id": "fj80lrp", "author": "WellWishesBot", "body": "**Hello there!**\n\nI'm here to send you well wishes on this wonderful day.\n\nThere's a lot of negativity in our world these days that you see all over social media.
