It's written for Python 2, and Python 2 has reached end of life. You should be using Python 3 in 2020. Python 3 has a few important backwards incompatible changes, and from what I can gather, the book does not cover them.\n\nI don't use books very much, but I see recommendations for [*Automate the Boring Stuff with Python*](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/) quite a lot here on this subreddit."}, {"id": "fj7yzw8", "author": "vmsda", "body": "If you are starting from scratch, don't waste cash on books. Start, for instance, on Youtube with Corey Schafer's videos - more than 100, from the very first steps.

It also reviews well on GoodReads.\n\nI bought my copy but it's also available on Library Genesis/B-Ok for free.\n\nI would recommend skipping ahead often and reading in whichever order you find high-yield for you. I found my interest waning a little during early chapters which focus on data-types, but skipping ahead to Ch. 7 to learn about while loops helped me. \n\nGood luck!"}, {"id": "fj7vcet", "author": "ZDRuX1", "body": "Unless you're writing for Python 3 and book is for 2.x, it's as valid today as it was when it came out."}]}
