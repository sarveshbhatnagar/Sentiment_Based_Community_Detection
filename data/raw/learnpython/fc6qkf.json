This uses the variable '**totalentries**'.  \n  \nNow I would like to make a similar script that searches the list of terms, and returns the number of items sold/ completed in the last 90 days ([example](https://imgur.com/a/uDiqPlG) of what I'm looking for).  However I can't find the right variable to use in place of \"totalentries\". Terms like \"TotalSold\", \"QuantitySold\", \"totalSoldQuantity\", \"SoldQuantity\", \"CompletedItems\", \"findCompletedItems\" will give a \"**AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'text'**\" error.\n  \nI found the original \"totalentries\" term from a tutorial, and now I have no idea how to hunt down the appropriate variable off the [ebay API developer site](https://developer.ebay.com). Can anyone guide me on how to find the magic word?\n    \n\n> from ebaysdk.finding import Connection as Finding  \n> from bs4 import BeautifulSoup  \n> import sys  \n> import time  \n>     \n  \n> ID_APP = '*****'  \n> \n> sys.stdout = open('output.txt', \"w\")    \n> \n> with open(\"input.txt\") as fl:  \n>     file_contents = [x.rstrip() for x in fl]  \n> \n> \n> for query in file_contents:  \n>     Keywords = query  \n>     api = Finding(appid=ID_APP, config_file=None)  \n>     api_request = { 'keywords': Keywords }  \n>     response = api.execute('findItemsByKeywords', api_request)  \n>     \nsoup = BeautifulSoup(response.content,'lxml')  \n>   \n>     \n**totalentries = int(soup.find('totalentries').text)**  \n>   \n>     \nprint(query, ';', totalentries)    \n>     time.sleep(1)", "comments": []}
