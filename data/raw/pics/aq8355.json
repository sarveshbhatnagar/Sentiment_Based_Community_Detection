The hope was that the rover would revive when the skies cleared, but it has not responded after months of efforts to contact it.\n\n>On Tuesday night, NASA made one last call to Opportunity. On Wednesday, the space agency is expected to announce that it is wrapping up the mission.\n\n[Source](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/13/science/mars-opportunity-rover-dead.html)"}, {"id": "ege4ua6", "author": "Xe1ex", "body": "This just seems like the perfect setup for a horror movie.

They close in on the unarmed astronauts, they've never tasted human blood, their mandibles are erect in anticipation. The astronauts hug one another, knowing this is the end. They look to the sky, hoping in vain to see a glimpse of the pale blue dot, the home they'll never see again. It's no use, the dust is too thick. Like many pioneers to this hellish world before them, they will perish under a red storm. They close their eyes and wait for death.\n\nWhen suddenly a blast is heard, a scream, and then another and another. They open their eyes. A cloaked figure has appeared out of nowhere, and is raining fire down on the creatures from above. They flee, back to the cracks in the Martian soil they crawled from, mandibles tucked between their six legs.\n\n\"But...who?\" The commander asks\n\nThe cloaked figure turns slowly with an odd whirring sound and lowers its hood.\n\n\"Impossible!\" The wide-eyed commander declares, \"You were lost over a hundred years ago!
