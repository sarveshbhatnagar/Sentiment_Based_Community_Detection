She was taking money from an academic publisher and a for profit college which were conflicts of interest.  As well there was some oddness with the hiring of family members.  Students occupied the admin buildings in protest and Fire Katehi was graffitied all over campus.\n\nUltimately, the president of the UCs intervened.  UC Davis hired a guy from Georgia Tech to replace her.  He seems to be an improvement."}, {"id": "dmx1xwh", "author": "bobikanucha", "body": "THE PERSON RESPONSIBLE FOR THIS IS RETURNING TO UC DAVIS. Chancellor Katehi the one who ordered the removal of the protesters was fired over her decision to do so. This year marks her return the school as a professor. Not only is she coming back but they are paying her THE SAME SALARY she had when she was chancellor(one of the highest paid people at the school). I really hope people see this as I'm surprised to see no mention of it in the comments. Ive seen comments asking why this is even relevant anymore and THIS is why. \n\nhttp://www.sacbee.com/news/local/education/article164312277.html"}, {"id": "dmwxfsh", "author": "TooShiftyForYou", "body": "*Police at first contended that the spray was the most appropriate tool on hand to deal with what they described as an unruly mob encircling the officers.*\n\n*However, a UC report in April 2012 declared that the pepper spraying violated policy and that school leaders badly bungled the handling of that campus protest. The investigating task force strongly rebutted campus police claims that the Occupy demonstrators who had pitched tents on a UC Davis quad posed a violent threat.*\n\n\n*In 2013, the former UC Davis police officer who pepper sprayed the campus protesters received $38,055 in workers' compensation after claiming he suffered depression and anxiety as result of the public outcry.*\n\n\n[Source](http://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-ln-uc-davis-pepper-spray-20160414-story.html)"}, {"id": "dmwx3xa", "author": "Academ1aNut", "body": "Guess it's not erased from the internet"}, {"id": "dmwx5id", "author": "allkill", "body": "Oi dickheads, pay me $50,000 and I'll make sure that I won't repost it back again.
