The second E train didn't open its doors or leave the station. Everyone started getting pissed. This guy next to me was just repeating over and over \"I'm from Marcy son. What up?\" and then wondering aloud why the train wasn't opening the doors or talking about how shit the MTA is (it's pretty bad right now.) I saw an MTA employee walking from car to car with a flashlight looking confused. Finally they opened the doors and started talking to people. I asked another man what happened; he said someone pulled the brake (emergency.) So we're all confused and looking around but the two MTA guys say we're gonna be pulling out shortly: \"We're just gonna have a look around and see if there's anything going on on the platform.\" \n\nThe doors half open and a couple with a baby is having trouble getting their carriage out of a half open door. The wife is fine but the guy is pissed. A bystander gets the MTA workers attention right as soon this guy gets the carriage through and then grabs his own water bottle and angrily throws it on the ground. The wife goes, \"what's your problem?\" It's a couples fight. He says something unintelligible like \"I just ugh fuckin!ugh\" and she looks at him half-embarrassed and half-pissed saying, \"that's _our_ water bottle.\" He doesn't even respond: just gives that 1000 yard stare. \n\nAt this point the MTA guys are looking at the connection between the two cars and there's a crowd behind them a few feet. One of the metal coils that connects the two cars is partly broken and they're lifting it up and down to see what happened. They start pointing their flashlights and looking into the tracks below. One of them in the orange jacket points down to what was probably right in front of the left car's first wheel and says, \"look there's a guy!\" kind of like it's so unbelievable that he can't even muster up the dramatic delivery necessary to make sure people believe him. It doesn't matter, though, cause he isn't lying. Im still not sure he said it (thought I misheard?) but everyone's crowding around so I take a peek myself and see a silver of what looks like white cargo shorts. The MTA guys are already rushing to call it in and maybe 10 people are looking with no supervision. I get my phone out to turn on the flashlight but I'm not close enough to get any light. Some other people have flashlights out and I see the whole cargo shorts, but you can't get a look at anything else. I just kind of assumed that I was looking at only half a body, and if I were to get down and really point my flashlight I'd see the other half cut clean, or maybe the head smashed under the wheels. I kind of wanted to check, but I figured people might think I look weird. At this point pretty much everyone around has realized what happened and backed away besides one dude who got a good look with his flashpoint. He gets up and I ask him, \"is he dead?\" The guy doesn't respond. I ask him again. The guy sort of gives me a vague response that I interpret as a yes, but I don't know if he spoke English. I start walking away with him and he meets a woman I assume was his wife, who rapidly interrogates him in Spanish. It's been a long time since my Spanish classes but she asked him something about a photograph. Fotografia was the only word I distinctly heard (and if there's one lesson here it's that my ears aren't as good as they used to be.) I think she either asked him why he took a photo or if he took a photo, but regardless the guy didn't want to talk about it and he immediately responded with a blunt, mumbled, negative sentence. His wife didn't like that and kept interrogating. \n\nWe were walking by others further down the track who were still waiting and I just motioned to a guy to start walking with a look on my face that he probably thought meant \"the annoying MTA fucked up again.\" I did it again to a second guy waiting and he asked me what happened. I just said, \"there was a jumper.\"\nEDIT: I forgot that at this time a child ran right by me (on the yellow line) straight towards the incident, his mother running behind him and brother behind her. I tried to tell her to stop him but they were far away before I processed exactly what they were about to see, how old they were, and the traumatizing effect this could have on them.\nThe guy kept walking with me for a bit and then asked, \"was it a suicide?\" I nod and say, \"I think so.\" I wish I had waited to see it out but I just left cause I didn't think there was gonna be much to see. I moved past the turnstiles and a guy asked this woman that was looking into the station why she was waiting. \"They're gonna pull out of the station soon,\" she says. I just shake my head and tell her the same thing I told the other guy, \"there was a jumper.\" It takes her a second. \n\nWe all walk out and I get about half a block away before I see/hear a fire truck. Impressive response time honestly. I talked to an NYC firefighter about this a few years ago. For those who don't know, the fire department deals with subway jumpers because of the electrical element. He told me that subway jumpers were the most fucked up of all things he'd ever seen. The wheels get so hot that they cut clean through and cauterize the wound immediately, meaning that some jumpers stay alive for long periods of time afterwards.\n\nNow that I think about it, though, I doubt the guy was actually dead. The brake was pulled and he must have pulled it. That means he stopped the train and then got down into the tracks. I bet it was some kind of suicidal cry for help, and I kind of hope I had stayed to see it through to the end. It was a pretty wild situation though."}]}
