You can't kill an ideology, look at Nazism as a perfect example of this. There is still work to be done. \n\nThis is also a drop in the bucket in bringing any form of peace to Syria. You still have Al-Nusra and HTS as the Islamic/Salafist-Jihadist elements in Syria. You have the SDF, you have Assad, and you have the Kurds who as ISIS is reduced will lose their common enemy and start fighting each other. \n\n I think it is starting to look like a failed state since there will be no way to reconcile all the parties and reform anything that looks stable. Especially given the actions of the US and Russia in this(to give some insight, Russia sees Iran as the regional power, Assad and the Ayatollah come from similar Shiite backgrounds of Twelver Shiism, so Russia sees these two states as their proxies. Iraq is currently in an odd situation since the leadership recently swapped from an Iranian backed Shiite regime in Al-Maliki to a Kurdish/Sunni regime. That shift probably brings Russia to see preserving Assad as a greater necessity.) \n\nAlthough people have said that Assad should remain it is pretty obvious that even if Syria is re-stabilized, how long can Assad last when the people to vehemently rejected him? the answer is not long, and because without a clear opposing voice to challenge him and an opposition filled with Salafist-Jihadists and loose rebel organizations in competition with one another, it is doubtful that Syria will be able to recover.
