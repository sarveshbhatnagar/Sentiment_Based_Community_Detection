I actually loved doing it and looked forward to it as it was just funny most of the time. I would show up at 2am to start cleanup and mostly involved throwing any large trash into the street for the large sweepers to pick up and taking down fence and throwing it onto a truck. It was a big night for people watching.  Biggest observations from the nights:\n\n- You constantly get hit on by drunk people even though they see you in uniform. Men and women alike.\n\n- the amount of naked people is impressive every year. You think you've seen it all and then some naked woman dances in a fountain. \n\n- Yes, there are large amounts of pee, poop and vomit on the streets and sidewalks and it's always staggering the amount of women that are carrying their uncomfortable club shoes and walking barefoot through it down the strip. \n\n- Fights are constantly happening. Between everyone and the police are quick to step in and come from out of nowhere. It's pretty amazing to see. They have a handle on it almost immediately and are quick to pull a shirt up over your head from the front almost like a hockey fight. It's super quick to diffuse the situation. \n\n- I still don't know the reason why but the thing that always got me was the unbelievable amount of baby strollers you'd find discarded. We're not just talking about the cheap, fold up type but the 100+ dollar Graco type ones. They're always mangled and you just look in horror at it wondering where the baby is, whether it's safe and what kind of terrible parent brings a baby to New year's Eve on the Las Vegas Strip? I've personally thrown a LOT of them into the street for the sweepers to collect. \n\nAll in all, I have to hand it to the police and city cleanup crews, they move through quick and clean up fast. I worked out there for almost 10 years and only saw 1 death on a night I was there as a civilian for 99/00 (man climbed a pole in front of Bellagio and grabbed power lines. Since then, most strip properties actually have poles removed from the front of their properties weeks before NYE) and haven't seen any real injuries. Hats off to the people that are part of the cleanup every year. It's hard work and you're exhausted afterward but it's unlike any other night of work you'll ever be a part of.
