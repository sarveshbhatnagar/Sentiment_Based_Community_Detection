The crater itself is centred at 165\u00b0 E, 73\u00b0 N on the martian surface. The image has aresolution of roughly 21 metres per pixel.  \n\n> This image was created using data from the nadir and colour channels of the High Resolution Stereo Camera (HRSC). The nadir channel is aligned perpendicular to the surface of Mars, as if looking straight down at the surface.\n\n[Here](https://www.google.com/mars/#lat=72.662262&lon=165.407016&zoom=6&q=Korolev%20crater) this is on Google Mars.\n\n[Here](https://trek.nasa.gov/mars/#v=0.1&x=165.79120226781475&y=72.96546543256117&z=6&p=urn%3Aogc%3Adef%3Acrs%3AEPSG%3A%3A104905&d=) it is on NASA's Mars Trek.\n\nEdit: Thank you for the correction /u/PageFault.

It's a real photograph, this one: http://www.esa.int/var/esa/storage/images/esa_multimedia/images/2018/12/plan_view_of_korolev_crater/18937953-1-eng-GB/Plan_view_of_Korolev_crater_node_full_image_2.jpg\n\nThen, since the picture is taken from above and they have a precise 3D map of the ground they just projected the picture on the 3D map so that we can see it from another angle, that's all. Which means, it's the same thing as when you look at google maps in 3D: it's real photos, and nobody claims, when they look at Google Maps in Satellite mode that it's \"a computer-generated image of the Earth\". When /u/pm_me_ur_big_balls claims it's \"a computer-generated image based on topographic data gathered\", it seems that he read somewhere how the 3D model of the ground was produced, not understanding the most important part: a real, high-res photograph of the ground was shot by ESA and projected on it. And no, they didn't \"just add the color\", the photograph was taken in color, as he quoted himself just above: the \"High Resolution Stereo Camera (HRSC)\" has color channels, it is a color camera.\n\nI would also like to reject the claim that I am a collection of sticks, as my title didn't imply anything else."}, {"id": "ec91flz", "author": "SubZeroEffort", "body": "There is water right nextdoor, we didn't have to look far.

It is an accurate view of what Korolev crater looks like, but it's not an actual ~~image~~ photograph.\n\n* **The most recent imaging data was taken in April.**  This image was just *released*, but the data that was used to make it isn't so new.\n\nAnd some facts that people seem to be confused about:\n\n* **We've known about water ice on Mars for quite a while.**  Even before spacecraft we have been able to observe Mars' polar ice caps, which are made of both water and CO2 ices.  [Here's a movie from Mariner 7](http://planetary.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/images/4-mars/2015/20150424_mariner7.gif) showing the northern ice cap in 1969.  For anyone interested in the history of the discovery of water on mars, see [this excellent wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronology_of_discoveries_of_water_on_Mars).\n\n* **We've known there is ice in Korolev crater for a while too.**  [Here's an mosaic of Viking images](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/2c/Mars_NPArea-PIA00161.jpg) from the 1970s and 1980s showing Mars' north pole (Korolev is white circle at the 1-o'clock position, halfway from the center).\n\nI don't want to seem like I'm coming down hard on OP, but I think it's important to share images of the planets with more context, as posts with almost no context can be misleading or a bit confusing.\n\nEdit: For clarity, photograph is probably the least ambiguous word to use when referring to an image taken by a spacecraft camera.  Image can potentially refer to both photographs and renders, at least in non-scientific publications."}, {"id": "ec91gp8", "author": "billwashere", "body": "This is huge right?
