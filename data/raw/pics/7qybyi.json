You probably won't see this. But my father had colon cancer when we first moved across country when I was 11. He found out because he needed to get his blood pressure, cholesterol, etc. medication refilled (he was about 52 at the time). He moved cross country for the job (from New York to Louisiana) and he went to the doctor and they did a full physical with blood tests. The doctor called a day later or so and said that he needed to come back in for more tests. Well after a colonoscopy and more blood tests... He had colon cancer. Just as I started school again (7th grader in a new state, living in a extended stay hotel). Couple weeks later he got the surgery and they took 18 inches out of his fucking colon. 18 inches. Couldn't believe it. But a few days after surgery when the doctors allowed him to walk again he walked as much as possible as often as possible and got back to health faster than the doctors thought. But he was motivated by his family and his new job to keep going keep working towards better health. He's been cancer free for about 10 years now.\n I just want you to know that it will get better and although cancer is hell and it takes a toll it will get better. There will be people in this world that love you and hope for the best of you even if they aren't your own family. I hope you get better man I really do. God speed and good luck my friend.

Fortunately didn't need chemo as it was caught early. You'll feel stronger every day. A couple things are important to know, and I wish I knew some of this stuff beforehand.\n\n It is not uncommon to have what is known as post-operative urinary retention. During any sort of pelvic surgery, the nerves Near the bladder can get beaten up a little bit. It took me nearly three months to get back to peeing again normally, but it did come back.\n\n Don't be surprised if it takes a little while to get a boner haha. For the same reasons above, Your sexual function may be off for a while. Although right now, the last thing you probably feel like doing is having sex haha.\n\n Get up and walk as soon as you can. The sooner, the better.\n\n Don't be afraid to ask for pain meds if you're in pain. It is important to stay ahead of the pain, because once you are in excruciating Agony, it is very difficult to get it back under control.\n\nWhen you're home, wound recovery will be vastly aided by ensuring that you are drinking at least two liters of water a day, that you take in a lot of vitamin C, ideally at least 1,000 MG, and that you are consuming additional protein.\n\nIf you have an ostomy is part of your surgery, it will take a little while to get used to it. I'm 3 months into my operation, and I'm still getting used to the fucker.\n\n You will get better. Keeping a positive attitude is critical. Your recovery may go extremely well, But you might have some complications along the way. Having a good support system and people to talk with and vent to is critical.\n\n There are lots of other things, please feel free to DM me if you want to talk.
