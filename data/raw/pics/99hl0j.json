Think on this: most kids in poverty have to help their families after school. Sometimes it\u2019s watching their siblings or cooking dinner or even helping bring in money with work. These kids are loaded down with responsibilities. The last thing they need is homework, especially busywork. These are the kids who feel different the second they walk into the middle class norms of American schools and homework only reinforces a sense of failure when they cannot complete it. They may not even have a pencil at home. Very different from the kids who have supportive families who yell at them to come in and do their homework from playing outside and then help complete it with them.
