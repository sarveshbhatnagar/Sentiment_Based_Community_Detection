Cynicism is an inevitable thing, but it might do more harm than good:\n\nThere are a disturbing number of posts here that are attempting to completely normalize the idea that 1) China taking HK early is inevitable, and 2) that there is nothing anyone can or will do about it.\n\nEither Reddit has become filled with sociopathic armchair assholes (racing to predict a horrible outcome), or some people really want to push a particular narrative and sow the seeds of defeatism for the benefit of a particular government.\n\nSeriously, what is the value in pushing that narrative? It's like going to a playground and yelling to children how their future is scorched Earth due to climate change because it is inevitable and no one cares. Are you right? Maybe. Should you share that position so brazenly and thoughtlessly? Fuck no.\n\nThe future of a few million people are potentially about to change drastically, for the worse, and here we have a room full of pricks jockeying for the rights to call themselves prognosticators. You erode people's sense of hope, will to fight oppression, and prime them to ignore the suffering of others, all so you can sit their smugly and say \"I told you so.\"\n\nMeanwhile, you are wrong. It may be very likely, but it is not inevitable. Speaking up against China will be costly, but not impossible or ineffective. The people of HK and China do care and notice who in the world has HKs back, and who in the world is readying to look the other way.\n\nThere is a sickening element here readying others to look the other way. Kinda reminiscent of bots from Russia, no? Certainly China wouldn't do anything like that."}, {"id": "ewrj8od", "author": "Usernamesareso90s", "body": "What can we do to help"}, {"id": "ewre7cf", "author": "BelleCurves76", "body": "Hong Kongers rise up."}, {"id": "ewrd3in", "author": "t-rex42", "body": "Considering the large mobilizations of the military into the area I would speculate that they will be shooting more than just an eye very soon.
