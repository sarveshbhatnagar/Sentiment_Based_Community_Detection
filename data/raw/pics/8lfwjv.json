At the time, I played my dad's trumpet, and it was 30 years old. That Christmas/birthday/the next Christmas my gift was my trumpet. I had to agree to play all the way through high school, and it was difficult for my parents to afford it- I believe it cost about $700-800. It cost enough that we timed the purchase for the same time we were going to a neighboring state that had no sales tax just to save the hundred bucks. I still remember the rain in the parking lot as I walked to the car, clutching the blue case to my chest. It was the most expensive thing I owned, or would own for a long time.\n\nBand got me up in the morning, it made it so I went to school even when other kids sucked. It gave me something to work for, it gave me camaraderie and made me depend on others as others depended on me. It gave me pride, and showed me the correlation between hard work and reward. It kept me in college when I may have otherwise chickened out, given up and gone home. There is no rush like running onto a field with 30k people screaming in the stands, and music was the only thing that would ever give me that feeling.\n\nI'm 33 now, and I don't play that much anymore- but that trumpet, a music stand and a book of exercises still sits next to my desk. I hope to allow my son to play it someday. The trumpet, band, music in general changed my life, it made me a better person and it made me who I am today. I'm getting choked up writing this, so I'll just say, this gift is powerful for someone like me, and something small really can change lives."}, {"id": "dzfd9cn", "author": "audguy", "body": "Holy shit I got my trumpet from them too!

I just wanted to take a quick moment to say thanks for the heart warming outpouring response to a letter written in 2009 that find its way to Reddit recently. We have been overwhelmed with the positive response, it has been so encouraging and uplifting. You may have noticed our site went down early this morning from the mass response, but we have fixed that and will continue to try and keep up with that. We love hearing from you and your own stories that this letter has reminded you of. One thing that we have always wanted to do is have a rental scholarship fund, where we could help more students access music education by either providing a free months rent or a full school year rental based on need. This is something we will be setting up in the coming days' so stay tuned! In the meantime, one of the most impactful things you can do is to visit your local music store, purchase an instrument and donate it to your local youth orochestra or a local band program. Again, we thank you for your awesome response and we look forward to serving our local communities with music education for years to come."}, {"id": "dzgrcli", "author": "reachouttouchFate", "body": "repost, as I was asked to put this as a direct reply to OP. This was from a call I placed shortly after the store opened this morning:\n\n> **update!**\n\n> I just got off the phone with their office. I didn't get to speak to Jim but another person there because she said he's been tied up on the phones since opening.\n\n> She confirmed the Miami store is a different store.\n\n> She also said they saw the OP and would prefer in lieu of monetary donations that people please consider turning their efforts to assisting their local high school band departments so that other kids who are less disadvantaged could be able to play instruments, as well.\n\n> I also apologized for overloading their bandwidth but noted we tend to be a good bunch and didn't intentionally mean to do that.\n\n> We ended with her saying the store appreciates us for trying to be of help.\n"}, {"id": "dzfcebg", "author": "glimmeringsea", "body": "Was your \"mom\" [an accessory to murder?](http://westorlandonews.com/woman-arrested-in-connection-with-ocoee-teen-murder/)"}]}
