My heart breaks - not for me, but for my love and best friend whom I have no choice but to leave behind, alone.\n\nOP is there one thing you wanted or needed to hear from your beautiful wife that she didn\u2019t say? It needn\u2019t be anything profound, just something extra that would have helped your heart heal. I don\u2019t want to miss my chance, and I\u2019m only getting one shot.\n\nGodspeed, OP. I\u2019ll tell your wife how you\u2019ve touched so many with the pictorial story of your love when I see her on the next level.

There are people around the world truly moved by your story, people around the world who will go out of their way to hold their loved ones a little tighter or say \"I love you\" that one more time than they would have done. Your love story has inspired that, help spread that love around the world and in doing so, make the world that little bit better.\n\nLife I can imagine is not going to be easy to recover, but you'll find a way I truly hope. But as someone else has said, thank you for sharing your story and thank you for spreading a message of love without constraint around the world, because I believe you have.\n\nThe chances are unlikely, but if you ever find yourself in a city called Norwich in Norfolk, England, send me a message, I'd happily buy you a drink and have a chat and thank you in person and listen to what you have to share.\n\n\nEdit: you guys are awesome and exactly what I mean about spreading their love around the world.\n\nEdit2: thank you all for making my evening, for showing the love and support we need to make the world a little bit better. I hope OP sees this and sees he has support all around the globe.\nTo any of you going through the same, similar or just need a bit of support, I hope this shows there are people out there, people who care and people who want to listen. You don't have to be alone.\n\nWherever you guys are, whatever you guys are doing reach out to someone if you can and let them know they are loved and also have a fantastic day or night and remember we are here and we care."}, {"id": "fjh991f", "author": "ATX_rider", "body": "I'm sorry for your loss but happy for whatever peace this brought you. \n\nIn May of 2017 I did the same thing for my brother, and for myself.

I don't really know what else to say to you at the moment, you're both so young and my heart breaks for you both and that potential snuffed out.\n\nSomething I always think of is a quote from Sheltering Skies by Paul Bowles\n\n\"Because we don't know when we will die, we get to think of life as an inexhaustible well. Yet everything happens only a certain number of times, and a very small number really. How many more times will you remember a certain afternoon of your childhood, an afternoon that is so deeply a part of your being that you can't even conceive of your life without it? Perhaps four, five times more, perhaps not even that. How many more times will you watch the full moon rise? Perhaps 20. And yet it all seems limitless.\"\n\nTake care OP.
