While that would normally merit a removal, we've decided to make a slight exception in this case. Our reasoning is as follows:\n\n1. The image is an aspect of a particularly impactful and important story.\n2. The digital elements included in the screenshot are small and unobtrusive enough to *almost* fall under the watermark-specific caveat outlined in Rule 1B.\n\nFurthermore, while the atrocities being committed are very disturbing, remember that encouraging or inciting violence \u2013 whether implicitly or explicitly \u2013 is directly against Reddit's site-wide rules... so while we may be justifiably outraged about what's taking place, please refrain from offering comments suggesting (for example) that Winnie the Pooh needs to be separated from his stuffing.
