A sort of 'adaptor' that just reformats certain data into another format, and then feeds it into the ACTUAL programm.\n\nThat misrepresentation of what she actually contributed and what she actually did is nauseing. Either nepotism on the part of the institution OR the media.\n\nSources :\n\nhere, what SHE wrote ( HOPSTOOLS ) : https://github.com/klbouman/hopstools\n\nHere the mother program, where that optional part of her is added, where it acts as a sort of interface to import one more datatype by reformatting it.\n\nsource : https://github.com/sao-eht/eat/graphs/contributors\n\nIt's kinda ridiculous, how the media morphs this into something COMPLETEY different.\n\nbtw: that's also NOT an algo, but just reformatting data.\n\nYou dont understand - she did NOT write and algo at all. sche did NOT write an image tool at all.\n\nWhat she did code is at max about 4 pages of code - but more importantly - is neither an algo, nor a imaging program but is an ADAPTOR for a source of data, which reformats the data to feed it into the mother program - of which she contributed that adaptor, which makes up ca 0.01% of said mother program at max AND is marked as \"optional\" part of the program\n\nsources : https://github.com/sao-eht/eat/graphs/contributors\n\nHer whole bundle (\"hopstools\") here was merged into the mother programm and counted as one commit of 'mother' program. hopstools, of which she did at max 25% Her share on contribution on this actual imaging program is about 0.3% max, but OK lets say 1% - So she did less than 1/4 of 1% of the work. max. If we're very generous.\n\nthis little part is the share that her contribution does.
