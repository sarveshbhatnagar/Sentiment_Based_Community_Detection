Stay home, limit contact with friends and family. Read a book, play a video game, watch a movie. Don't go to the birthday event, a bar, or to the gym.\n2. Netflix, YouTube Premium and certain movies should be on a large discount or free, so more people would stay home and not contract the infection.\n3. Order groceries and food online and let them bring to your door. Wait 30 minutes to 1 hour in order to avoid the possible contamination from a delivery person. Your milk or ham won't spoil.\n4. Increase payouts to food delivery personnel and encourage them at least to wear a mask and carry a hand sanitizer.\n5. Prohibit all public events for just 2-3 weeks.\n6. Asian countries wear masks. Look at China, the infection rate is going down. 99.9% of the Chinese people did not get infected and the country is recovering!\n7. Do not air travel or go on a cruise. Air circulation in the airplane pretty much guarantees you getting the virus.\n8. If you are sick and between 18-59 years old, SELF-quarantine yourself and isolate from everyone!\n9. If you are sick and your age is 60+ OR if you have underlying medical conditions, then go to the doctor. In this case, the best course of action would be to mobilize special ER service, in which the service arrives at your home with the special protective equipment. Going to the doctor by yourself will just infect more people while you travel.\n10.
