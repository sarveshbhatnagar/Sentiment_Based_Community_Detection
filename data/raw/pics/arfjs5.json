If you're having difficulty some people told me Costco does it also. \nThere is also converters you can buy at best buy or other electronics stores to do it at home yourself. \nYou can buy as well a DVD/VCR recorder combo which plays both and can record non protected tapes that way.\nSome local libraries may do it for cheap or free also!\nThanks for the comments humans \u2661\n"}, {"id": "egmufn1", "author": "realmwalker", "body": "A letter with an ink signature too.
