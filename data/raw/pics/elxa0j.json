Over the years, I have gone back to Iran a few times, as recently as a year ago.\n\nI have the same love for both Iran and the United States and I can attest that Iranian people truly love the American people and want nothing but peace and friendship with the Americans. Those who chant \"death to America\" are part of the Iranian government and account for a very small number of the population. Unfortunately the Iranian news outlets, which are run by the Iranian government only broadcasts these hateful idiots to try to influence the rest of the population, which has not worked well for them over the years. At the same time the U.S. media outlets also only shows those same hateful idiots for their own propagandas and to spread fear so they can manipulate people's emotions to get better ratings, because they have learned that nothing sells better than fear.\nPlease do not fall for these manipulative tactics by both sides and KNOW that you are truly loved by the Iranian people.\n\nEdit: Thank you all for your lovely and warm responses. I have read them all, and I am very proud and happy to know that there are still MANY good hearted people out there who have genuine empathy for others.\n\nI love you all and wish you all nothing but happiness for many years to come. \n\nLet's be better for one another and build a better and more peaceful society for our future generations.\n\nPlease get out and vote when the time comes.
