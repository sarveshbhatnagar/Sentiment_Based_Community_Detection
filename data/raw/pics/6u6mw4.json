Get the fuck off your phone.  God damn eye strain is one of the leading causes of sever headaches.  \n\nAt least use the TV which is outta screen and at least a good distance away.  \n\nBest bet its to kill all screens, drinks some water, and take a multivitamin.  Close your eyes and wait for it to pass.  Most headaches are either dehydration, vitamin deficiency, or eye strain (or some combination of those, *edit: in that order btw).  Not to say it will solve it but god damn if you got a horrible headache dont add to it by focusing your eyes that close.   \n\nEdit 2: Also BTW that is one of the best reasons to upgrade your computer at work.  Get a 120hz screen.  Reduces eyestrain huge.  Also, get a bigger monitor and get back if you have the option.  Put distance between you and the screen and up the resolution.  Seriously.
