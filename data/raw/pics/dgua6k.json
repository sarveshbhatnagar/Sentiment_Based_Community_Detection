Apparently he was spotted taking the photo and ended up hiding the roll of film in a film canister in the water tank of his toilet. He then replaced the film in his camera with an empty roll of film. The police came in stole the camera and (empty) film and he smuggled the real roll with this photo out. The details may be wrong but I remember it being a kinda wild story about this picture."}, {"id": "f3ezwuo", "author": "PM_Me_Your_Furbabies", "body": "From [this video](https://youtu.be/dlo-ZzECkBA) we can see that someone stops to speak to Tank Man. More people appear running onto the scene and grab Tank Man, rushing him away before signalling to the tanks.\n\nNobody knows who Tank Man was or what happened to him. It's suggested that the people who grabbed him were plain-clothed officers. Considering what they did to the students in that square I don't have high hopes that they took him back home and he lived a long happy life.\n\nEDIT: the owner of the original video I posted disabled playback on applications other than YouTube.

I always find the most striking thing about this photograph is the behavior of the tanks.
