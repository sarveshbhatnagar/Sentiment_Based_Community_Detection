In the very likelihood of it being indefinite. It's been a real great 5 years entertaining you all.  It really was life-changing. But unfortunately it can't always go on. Soon enough I won't have the time to keep doing this anymore.\n\n> I have my job.  I have dates.  I have vacations planned.  I want to see more of my friends and family. I need to get back to my exercise routine. And we aren't even talking about going back to school yet. Most of all, I have other long-term artistic projects in the works that's going to take up a large chunk of my free time. Time I can't really spend on drawing random things on Reddit. I much rather detach myself from AWildSketchAppeared and try something new. Since this is in retrospect  just a simple novelty account.\n\n> This doesn't mean I'm abandoning Reddit altogether.  I do make use of my non-novelty account and will keep posting through there. I'm not going to delete /u/AWildSketchAppeared as it really is a piece of internet history and the only real way to see all the work I've done in these 5 years. It will stay there as long as Reddit is still a thing.\n\n> I figure this might be the best way to get this message across to the community.
