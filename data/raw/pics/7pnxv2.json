As a teenager growing up in Toronto, Ontario, he was more into playing ice hockey than anything (he is, after all, a Canadian\u2014eh).\n\n\u201cI started when I was 22,\u201d said Reeves. \u201cI was filming in Munich, Germany, at this film studio, and this young girl had a gorgeous (Kawasaki) Enduro motorcycle which she would drive around. One day I asked her to teach me how to ride it. So I started to ride that bike around the stage when she wasn\u2019t using it, and when I got back to Los Angeles, I got the first bike I saw that was similar. .\"\n    \n\u201cI don\u2019t go as fast as I used to,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t have a sense of fear, it\u2019s just that I\u2019ve had enough accidents, a ruptured spleen, a lot of scraped skin and road rash that I don\u2019t really feel the need to test the limits as much. I also don\u2019t use riding a motorcycle as a way of getting rid of anger or frustration the way I used to. When I was younger, I used to get out on the road with the bike and just go as fast as I could and basically let it all out on the road. But after enough wipeouts, you begin to think that that\u2019s not a really good frame of mind to be in when you\u2019re riding a motorcycle at high speed (laughs).\u201d\""}, {"id": "dsin3s9", "author": "lornstar7", "body": "I don't care much about celebrities, but I'd definitely want to hang out with Keanu"}, {"id": "dsior4p", "author": "poopellar", "body": "Keanu Revs."}, {"id": "dsinovc", "author": "LizardBurger", "body": "I feel like most celebrities don't want to be noticed in public, but Keanu is like, \"Look at me.
