THE picture, means THE picture on the poster, was definitely NOT on that list. Washington posts relies on the idea it's readers are dumb enough to not double check. They even have a link to the actual list and an item number i that anyone can follow, but they assume nobody will, coz they take their readers as a cattle. \n\nYou download the list, you search for the number, you read the exact description. Neither the OP's picture or the poster, shown in the WP article are not described there.\n\nA picture from [this](http://vk.com/id161877484) exact post with [this](http://img1.reactor.cc/pics/post/%D0%BF%D0%BE%D0%BB%D0%B8%D1%82%D0%BE%D1%82%D0%B0-%D0%BF%D0%B5%D1%81%D0%BE%D1%87%D0%BD%D0%B8%D1%86%D0%B0-115733.jpeg) exact text has been listed. Good luck finding the original picture. I couldn't. And the account has been either made private or simply unaccessible by me.\n\nThe reason for listing was a ruling of the Court of city of Tver in May 2016 to regard the above-mentioned picture with hate speech and many others, including those calling to attack on \"cops, churkas and jews\", portraying Putin as nazi and such as extremist. The person himself seems to me is a neo-nazi. Those items are numbered 4065 through 4074, but somehow only number 4071 has caught WP attention. I'm sure they have just forgot to mention others, but totally meant to. ;)\n\nDouble check your \"facts\". Double check your media.
