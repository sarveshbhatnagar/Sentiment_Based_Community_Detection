I\u2019ve shared some of your comments with the other members of my support group, and many of them have been so touched by your kind remarks. For those of us who live controlled by a constant fear, being able to relate to people we\u2019ve never even met or even just being shown kindness in general can be a rare occurrence.\n\nWe\u2019ve spent the majority of our lives being dismissed by people, being told to \u201cget over it\u201d. We are constantly reminded of the irrationality of our fears \u2013 *we know* \u2013 by the people we love most, the people we long to be accepted by. Family, friends, lovers, partners, spouses snubbing the steps we take to avoid encountering what we fear most. In some cases, they take extreme measures in an effort to fix us; in many cases, making them much worse. I think of Don, a young boy with bright green eyes, screaming and crying in the darkness of a locked closet, and I shed a tear thinking of it now.\n\nFrom the bottom of my heart, thank you. I\u2019d love to skip ahead and share with you the situation I am in now, the \u201ccure\u201d that was revealed to me, but it remains important to the process that I follow the order that was assigned to us the moment we first took our seats in the empty classroom of that old, abandoned church. It is important that I honor the stories that came before me, because they have fundamentally changed my life. For now, that means I must go back to participant number five.\n\n\\---\n\n\u201cWell, that\u2019s enough of that,\u201d Don commented mere moments after finishing his tale, his demeanor shifting instantly from despondence to his normal, casual attitude. He leaned back in his chair, kicking his feet out in front of him, tattered white tennis shoes squeaking on the linoleum floor. I was suddenly reminded of my own father, who would wear a pair of sneakers until the soles were practically worn through. An, if it ain\u2019t broke, don\u2019t fix it, kind of guy. \u201cWho\u2019s next?\u201d\n\nI was startled by a sound to my immediate right, Edie clearing her throat several times.\n\n\u201cI think I\u2019m supposed to go next,\u201d she muttered, unfolding her paper to confirm that she was indeed participant number five.\n\nThe elderly woman appeared to be at least ninety years old, though I only based this assumption on her striking similarity to my own grandmother in the years before she passed. The same white, permed hair, the string of large pearls around her neck with earrings to match, the sweet, gentle smile and almost melodic cadence to her voice that had put me at ease throughout the group thus far. She had the same delicate hands, with pale, paper thin skin barely masking the underlying, bones, veins, joints enlarged from arthritis. The only major difference between them was the black sweat suit she was dressed in. My Granny Ruth wore pastels and bright hues; she always said that black is for mourning, not for living.\n\nEdie slipped her paper back into her pants pocket before introducing herself, \u201cI\u2019m Obedience, but all my friends call me Edie. I have bathmophobia.\u201d A sly smile crossed her wrinkled features as she wagged a finger at Don, clearly in jest. \u201cAnd before you go off about it, Don, I\u2019m not afraid of taking a bath!\u201d\n\nThe group erupted into laughter, with Don joining in.\n\n\u201cWhat are you afraid of then, Edie?\u201d Valo inquired, the sound of his booming baritone voice signaling for the group to settle, much like a professor\u2019s.\n\nThe elderly woman waited for the laughter to die down completely before answering, \u201cI\u2019m afraid of stairs.\u201d\n\nNodding, I could understand why someone of her age might have such a fear \u2013 a fall down a flight of stairs would almost certainly leave her with a broken hip, or worse.\n\n\u201cNow, I know what you\u2019re thinking \u2013 an old thing like me, of course I\u2019m afraid of stairs! One tumble down and I\u2019d be in the hospital, if I was even lucky enough to be wearing my Life Alert,\u201d she remarked with a wink. \u201cI\u2019ve been afraid of stairs since I was a child. I was actually the only child with the phobia the family doctor had ever seen at the time it first arose.\n\n\u201cAlthough, when I was a child, I believe I actually had climacophobia, the fear of *climbing* stairs, not just the stairs themselves\u2026 but we didn\u2019t have all these different names for everything back then,\u201d she continued, raising a thin eyebrow. \u201cBut, explicitly named or not, I was darn horrified of climbing stairs. When I was around ten years old, I suffered a terrible fall down the stairs in my family home.\n\n\u201cI grew up wealthy, in one of those old money families, so we had this massive marble staircase with several turns coming down from the upper floor. I was playing at the top of the stairs when I lost my balance and tumbled all the way down. Gosh, I nearly broke every bone in my body, but it could\u2019ve been a lot worse. It took what felt like decades to recover\u2026 as a child, not being able to do much more than lie in bed was absolute misery. But still, I was a strong little girl and I got better\u2026 mostly, that is.\u201d\n\nStubbing out what must have been the hundredth cigarette she\u2019d burned through since she first arrived, Tegen lifted her sunken eyes to meet Edie\u2019s. \u201cYour body recovered, but your mind never did, eh?\u201d\n\nEdie pointed an index finger at Tegen. \u201cYou got it. I refused to go up or down that staircase. Father tried to force me, but I just felt dizzy and anxious as soon as I set foot on that first step up. My mind blew the incline way out of proportion\u2026 to climb that set of stairs felt comparable to scaling the face of a mountain, almost entirely vertical.\n\n\u201cFrom there, well, it was all downhill,\u201d she declared as she glanced down into her lap, tut-tutting gently. \u201cI couldn\u2019t go back to school, so mother homeschooled me. I lost all of my friends. All I had for the rest of my childhood was my books, my garden, an overwhelmed mother, and a father who thought I was broken, worthless.\u201d\n\nThe white-haired woman sighed deeply as she reflected on the sudden turn her life had taken at such a young age.\n\nThomasine broke the silence, chiming in with, \u201cEdie, you were not - *are* not worthless.\u201d\n\n\u201cThank you, dear,\u201d Edie replied warmly, folding her hands neatly over her knees as she straightened her posture. \u201cAs I became an adult, there was much argument around the house about what I could possibly amount to with my\u2026 *condition*. My parents wanted me to marry a man of wealth and status, but none would have me. So, when the mailman saw me out in my garden and we took a liking to each other, father said to him, his voice muddled with whiskey, if you want her, you can take her.\u201d\n\nCecily scoffed from across the circle \u2013 my sentiment exactly.\n\nEdie chuckled lightly in return. \u201cWe married, and we had a fairly decent life. He didn\u2019t make much money, but he worked hard. We cared about each other, though we grew distant over time. He was initially very supportive of my phobia, but as we grew older and as my parents passed, one right after the other, he insisted that we move into their house, the one with the marble staircase. He was tired of working his fingers to the bone and wanted some measure of comfort.\n\n\u201cI agreed\u2026 reluctantly,\u201d she recalled cautiously, her anxiety surrounding the arrangement clear. \u201cAll of the things I\u2019d need were set up on the ground floor at first, but eventually he wanted to move into the master bedroom upstairs together. I worked tirelessly to overcome my fear, not wanting it to control me anymore. For months, he\u2019d hold onto me as I walked first up one step, then several, then finally the entire staircase\u2026 though I must admit, I vomited right on the floor the first time I made it to the top!\u201d\n\nLaughing in spite of herself, she shook her head slightly. \u201cI was still a little anxious and dizzy each time, but as long as I had my husband with me, I could finally climb those darn stairs!\u201d\n\nA puzzled look came over Alec\u2019s face. \u201cIt seems like you\u2019ve overcome your phobia \u2013 mostly, at least. Why are you here?\u201d\n\nEdie\u2019s brow furrowed, the wrinkles on her forehead deepening in a somber expression. \u201cBecause it came back, five or so years ago, but much, much worse,\u201d she answered grimly, wringing her hands together so tightly I feared the fragile skin would tear. \u201cI woke up late one night, alone. My husband wasn\u2019t one to get out of bed in the middle of the night, so I was immediately worried. I sat up in bed and noticed a dim light spilling in from the hallway. I went to investigate, and found that the chandelier was on, the one that lit the stairway, that the staircase curled around beneath.\n\n\u201cAnd then my husband emerged from the darkness of the hallway and pushed me.\u201d\n\nI gasped involuntarily. \u201cNo!\u201d\n\n\u201cI fell down the first set of steps to the landing,\u201d she responded, her voice soft and unnerving. \u201cI heard my husband\u2019s bare feet slapping on the marble steps as he came down after me. I decided to act like I\u2019d gone unconscious, and when he reached me on the landing, I grabbed him by the ankles and shoved him down. I watched as he crashed down the remaining stairs, though I couldn\u2019t see him at the bottom because of the turns in the staircase.\n\n\u201cNow, I knew he\u2019d just tried to kill me, but I wasn\u2019t about to just leave him there to die. My body aching, I got back up to my feet. I looked down at the steps I\u2019d been able to descend for years at that point as they suddenly grew monstrously steep, with each step at least several feet deep. Both hands clinging to the rail, I slowly took the first step, paused a moment to collect myself, and kept going. My hands slick with sweat, my grip on the rail was very precarious, but I kept going until I reached the second landing.\n\n\u201cThat staircase had three flights of stairs with eight steps each, and two landings in between. I know this for a fact because I\u2019d learned to count each step to keep myself calm. Now that I was on the second landing, I knew that as soon as I turned the corner, there would only be one flight left, and then I\u2019d get to my husband.\n\n\u201cImagine my horror, however, when I turned to take the last set of steps, I couldn\u2019t see my husband at the bottom, nor the bottom of the staircase at all, as another landing had appeared. And then, *thunk*\u2026 a new step unfolded at the bottom\u2026 *thunk, thunk, thunk, thunk, thunk, thunk, thunk*, seven more, in rapid succession, a new flight of eight steps down to yet another new landing\u2026\u201d\n\nEdie closed her eyes tightly, breathing in through her nose, and out through pursed lips \u2013 likely a learned coping mechanism for anxiety. \u201cStill, I soldiered on, afraid for both mine and my husband\u2019s lives, down what should have been the last flight of stairs and onto the new one when the loud sounds of new steps falling into place rang out through my house once more.\n\n\u201cMy husband started to groan, began to cry, begging for help, asking what had happened. I called down to him that there\u2019d been an accident\u2026 he grumbled for a few moments, then began to yell\u2026\n\n\u201c*Obedience, you worthless piece of shit, you get down here right now!*\u201d she exclaimed in a voice so vile, so hateful, I could barely believe it came out of her. \u201cI tried to explain what was going on, but the words wouldn\u2019t come to me, and as I kept climbing down the stairs, more and more appeared, increasing exponentially, the *thunking* sounds incessant, deafening, until I felt impossibly high up, yet as I looked back, the stairs continued to stretch so far behind and above me that I couldn\u2019t even see the top anymore, the chandelier nothing but a speck of light, distant like a star in the night.\n\n\u201cI continued down, frantic and hysterical, trapped in this never-ending maze of stairs, all the while my husband alternating between pleading gently with me and shouting at me, insulting me, ordering me to hurry up and help him. By the time the end was in sight and I finally made it down, I was soaked in sweat, my legs trembling from overexertion and\u2026 my husband had fallen silent.\u201d\n\nThe elderly woman began to cry quietly as she continued, \u201cI rushed to the phone to call for help. An ambulance came soon after, as they opened the door\u2026 I noticed it was morning. Looking back up at the stairs, I realized I\u2019d spent at least twelve hours climbing down twenty-four steps. My husband had died.\n\n\u201cDesperate for some sort of connection to family now that I had none, I looked back into my family\u2019s history soon after my husband\u2019s passing. I discovered that my grandmother Obedience, who I was named for, passed away after a fall down that very staircase. I found some old pictures of her and, my goodness\u2026 she looked *just* like me.\n\n\u201cThere were rumors that her husband had pushed her to her death\u2026 after my own husband pushed me that awful night, I\u2019m convinced that\u2019s the truth. I know now that, my husband wasn\u2019t himself when he tried to kill me\u2026 as I pushed him down, he looked\u2026 *confused*,\u201d she explained, pulling a tissue out of her pocket to collect her tears. \u201cI\u2019ve been terrified of the sight of stairs ever since. I can\u2019t climb a staircase, let alone look at one, without dissolving into an immediate panic attack.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know if any of you believe in destiny or anything of the sort, but I believe it is my fate to die like my grandmother Obedience did, broken and bloodied at the bottom of a staircase. I\u2019ve survived it twice now, and I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll be so [lucky next time](https://www.reddit.com/r/hercreation).\u201d\n\n[I](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/fo51xt/i_joined_a_support_group_that_promised_to_cure_me/) | [II](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/fpaj6j/i_joined_a_support_group_that_promised_to_cure_me/) | [III](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/fsl6tt/i_joined_a_support_group_that_promised_to_cure_me/) | [IV](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/fuv5as/i_joined_a_support_group_that_promised_to_cure_me/) | V\n\n[WATCH](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCk1WJMX5xj1FHruveKH8gmg/videos?view_as=subscriber)", "comments": [{"id": "fmomo5h", "author": "NoSleepAutoBot", "body": "It looks like there may be more to this story.
