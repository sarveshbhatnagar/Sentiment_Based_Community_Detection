He was born without eyebrows, had a pet rock farm, and had a snake with his mother\u2019s face tattooed on his neck. He was (h)armless enough though, a bit on the odd side, sure, but we\u2019re all a bit eccentric when you think about it. I for one can\u2019t go a day without rearranging my dresser. Doesn\u2019t matter how tidy it is, or what system I\u2019m using, or how neatly it is all folded; I simply have to tear into that sucker and do it all over again.\n\nKlaus\u2019 family were german immigrants. Or was it dutch? Belgian? Moroccan? European at least, they\u2019re all basically the same country over there anyway. They\u2019d lived here since long before we ever moved in, but now there was only Klaus left. No wonder he\u2019d lost it a little, I always thought. Being alone for so long, knowing your family is more or less extinct. He seemed rather flustered when he first met us, but I always figured he was just very self conscious, you know, because of the missing arm. Lost it in a tractor accident apparently. A very peculiar man indeed.\n\nThen there was my daughter.\n\nAmbrosia was five years old when I started noticing her *eccentricity*. She\u2019d stubbed her toe on a chair - we\u2019ve all been there - and I was taken aback by the ferocity of her anger. She\u2019d cry, sure, but she\u2019d also throw furniture around herself in a wild frenzy. Larry, my husband, her father, tried to calm her down, but his noodly spaghetti arms were never built for manual labor I\u2019m afraid. In the end we resorted to locking her in her room, waiting out the proverbial storm.\n\nThe next day Larry was out trimming our rose bushes, his spindly stick-figure arms struggling under the weight of the gardening shears, when Klaus approached him, blood dripping from the bandages around his remaining hand. \n\n\u201cWhat happened to your hand?\u201d I imagine Larry asking.\n\n\u201cPet rock bit me,\u201d I imagine Klaus answering.\n\nLarry wasn\u2019t one for investigative questioning, so I suppose the conversation ended with him commenting on the weather. Klaus seemed pretty out of it though, Larry noticed. Even more so than usual. He kept asking about Ambrosia, how she was doing, how she was feeling, and it rubbed my Larry in all the wrong ways.  \n\nA few weeks later Ambrosia cut herself on a pair of scissors. Nothing serious or anything, just a little nick on her thumb, but it was enough to send her screaming into one of her explosive tantrums. Larry didn\u2019t know what to do, big surprise, so I ended up having to physically constrain her by more or less sitting on her. I could see bluish serpentine veins protruding from her forehead as she clawed at the floor hysterically, and at that point I was mere seconds away from just calling a priest. \n\nThe ambulance arrived half an hour later. Ambrosia had calmed down at that point, and we all peered out from behind the curtains curiously as they carried Klaus away. I don\u2019t know what was said, or what had happened exactly, but I noticed the paramedics exchanging worried glances. It was Larry who saw it. You can say a lot of things about my Larry, but he\u2019s nothing if not very selectively perceptive.\n\n\u201cWhere\u2019s his foot?\u201d he asked rhetorically. It was rhetorical because there wasn\u2019t a foot.\n\nKlaus came back a week later, limping around on crutches. His foot was still nowhere to be seen, Larry astutely observed, but Klaus seemed to be in good spirits considering the circumstances. In fact, he didn\u2019t mention the missing limb at all. Just kept asking about Ambrosia, and how she was doing, and if she\u2019d had a good week. I found the line of questioning quite absurd, bordering on outright creepy, but decided it\u2019d be better to just let it go. He was probably still in shock or something.\n\nAmbrosia liked Klaus, but I don\u2019t think Klaus liked her back. I chalked it up to him being who he was, an eccentric oddball, and the fact that he was unimaginably awkward. Maybe he hadn\u2019t been around children that much? He never allowed her on his property, but at the same time he wasn\u2019t being a dick about it. He\u2019d just gently remind us to *keep our lithe offspring on our side of the fence*, as he\u2019d put it.\n\nThe third time Ambrosia blew up was a bad one, for all the people involved. It was about a month after the foot-incident, and we\u2019d all slowly started getting back to normal again, when she decided to investigate her father\u2019s razor. Kids do that, you know. Monkey see, monkey do. Anyway, she cut her face up pretty bad, and there was a lot of blood everywhere. The bathroom looked like something out of a horror movie or something, and poor Larry ran around in panic like a headless chicken when we heard the screams. I managed to get her out of there by dragging her by her feet.\n\nBut that wasn\u2019t the end of it.\n\nHer anger was relentless, and she swung the razor around in a crazed frenzy, cutting both me and Larry, in the arm and neck respectively, before I was able to subdue her, and take the razorblade away. Mere seconds after I\u2019d calmed her down though, we heard the horrid, bloodcurdling shrieks coming from next door.\n\nYou know, up until that point I hadn\u2019t been able to connect the dots. I mean, how could I? It\u2019s not something you do. Not a conclusion you\u2019d just automatically jump to. But seeing poor Klaus crawl out the front door like a disfigured caterpillar, his remaining arm no longer remaining, I don\u2019t know, my mind just instantly went there.\n\n*Is this because of Ambrosia?*\n\nLarry called the paramedics in between slipping around in a mixture of ours and Ambrosia\u2019s blood, his hysterical high-pitched voice causing some amount of confusion on the other end. Eventually I just had to grab the phone, give them our address, and run out to the hemorrhaging Klaus, wrapping whatever I could find around the stump of his arm to stop the blood flow. Miraculously enough he survived, but I still can\u2019t remember how we pulled it off. All I remember is what he whispered to me in between those tormented sobs.\n\n\u201cPlease, keep her happy while I\u2019m away.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s such a strange thing to say, isn\u2019t it? There he was, bleeding to death, and all he could focus on was Ambrosia? I spent quite a few sleepless nights pondering what he meant by it. Why did he care? Did he know? That it was Ambrosia who caused it? I wasn\u2019t sure myself, of course, because it was such a ridiculous, outlandish thought. But you didn\u2019t see her. Didn\u2019t see her face when she went all berzerk. It wasn\u2019t pretty. It was...demonic.\n\nI heeded his advice though, and kept a watchful eye on Ambrosia for the next couple of weeks, until Klaus was let out from the hospital. It was a strange sight to behold, a none-armed, one legged man hopping around, no one around to help him get into his locked house. I had to convince Larry to go help him out, and after a brief argument involving me pointing out several missing key characteristics of his personality, he humbly agreed.\n\nWhen he came back he had this look on his face. Disbelief, I suppose. He sauntered into the living room, gaze kept steadily at the floor, sighing deeply.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s going on, Larry?\u201d I asked.\n\n\u201cHe wants us to move,\u201d Larry said, shuffling around nervously. \u201cSays it\u2019s for our own safety.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d I exclaimed, staring at him firmly. \u201cWhy? What the heck does he mean by that?\u201d\n\n\u201cSays our daughter is causing him distress,\u201d he shrugged helplessly. \u201cWhat do you think? Should we do it?\u201d\n\nI wanted to scream *NO OF COURSE NOT LARRY, YOU STUPID HECKING CLOWN*, but deep down I knew there was something very sinister going on, and that *something* definitely involved our dear Ambrosia. Larry didn\u2019t see it like I did, but then again he wasn\u2019t the brightest closet in the shed, so I didn\u2019t expect him to.\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d I murmured. \u201cI think maybe it\u2019s for the best.\u201d\n\nWe never planned on staying in that house forever anyway. It was a fixer-upper, and we\u2019d fixed her up quite nicely, and maybe now was the time to move on. We\u2019d get a good deal on it, perhaps even enough for us to move back into the city. Yes, all in all it was a blessing in disguise. A silver lining behind limbless clouds. \n\nThe next week or so we spent looking into realtors, and packing non-essentials. We didn\u2019t know how long it would take, but we figured we should be prepared nonetheless. Worst case scenario we could move in with my sister for a few weeks, until we found ourselves a new home. \n\nKlaus kept to himself, periodically peeking out at us behind closed curtains. I felt so sorry for him, hopping around helplessly, all alone in that old house. *How does he brush his teeth*, I kept thinking. *How does he pour milk into his cereal*? I suppose I was too wrapped up in everything. Didn\u2019t see it coming. Didn\u2019t notice Ambrosia sneaking outside to play with the gardening shears (of which I specifically told Larry to put back in the toolshed).\n\nWhen I heard her shrieking I knew it was bad. I don\u2019t know how she did it, but the doctors later told us she was lucky she didn\u2019t sever a major artery. A long, deep gash from her thigh all the way down to her toes. Her pants were soaked in blood when I found her violently stabbing the rose bushes with the shears, screaming bloody murder. I grabbed her and disarmed her in one fell swoop, then ran back to the house yelling for Larry to call an ambulance.\n\nBut then I stopped.\n\nA harrowing thought entered my mind. Klaus. I had to check in on Klaus. If it was in any way possible that Ambrosia\u2019s tantrums, inadvertently or otherwise, somehow led to his horrible \u201caccidents\u201d, I simply *had* to make sure he was OK.\n\nSo with Ambrosia under one arm, and the shears in the other, I turned on the dime and bolted to Klaus\u2019 front door instead, leaving poor Larry behind stringing together incoherent sentences to the 911 operators. I guess the adrenaline got most of the job done, because when I more or less kicked open his door I didn\u2019t even feel winded. I staggered into his messy, dark hallway, shouting his name in a high-pitched, desperate voice.\n\n\u201cKlaus?! Klaus?!\u201d I yelled, stomping further in with Ambrosia screaming under my arm.\n\n\u201cKaren?\u201d Klaus answered, his wide-eyed visage suddenly popping out from behind a corner. \u201cDid you fucking bring the girl with you?!\u201d\n\nI stared at the still shrieking Ambrosia writhing under my arm. \u201cUh, yes?\u201d I muttered, slightly taken aback by his intensity.\n\n\u201cFucking shit, Karen!\u201d he yelled furiously, spit flying everywhere. \u201cYou really shouldn\u2019t have done that. Oh shit, oh fuck. This is bad, Karen. Really fucking bad. Get the fuck out of here! Now!\u201d\n\nHe disappeared behind the corner again, but I could hear him descending steadily down some stairs, the ominous sounds of continuous one-legged hopping slowly fading the further down he went. I didn\u2019t know what to do, so I did the only neighborly thing I could think of; I followed him down there. He was getting my help whether he wanted it or not. \n\nAmbrosia was practically foaming at the mouth at this point, and I was having a hard time holding on to her as I found myself stumbling down some crude wooden steps at the end of another hallway. A faint, flickering light from below, and the barely audible echo of Klaus hopping, were the only things guiding my rapid descent, and I still consider it something of a miracle that I even got down those stairs in one piece.\n\nA dark corridor met me once I reached the bottom, and I hustled onwards without thinking twice. Ambrosia had calmed down some, but as we rounded the corner leading up to Klaus, I made the grave mistake of bumping her head into the cold brick wall, causing her to erupt into one of her unpredictable frenzies once more. I caught a glimpse of Klaus sitting at the end of the corridor, his bloodshot, tear-filled eyes expressing nothing but utter fear and shock.\n\n\u201cNo!\u201d he screamed at the top of his lungs. \u201cGet her out of here! I can\u2019t hold her back!\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d I yelled back, desperately trying to muffle Ambrosia\u2019s hysterical wails.\n\nI didn\u2019t see her at first, but as Klaus scrambled to his foot clumsily, I noticed something behind him. A shape, I suppose. Or an amorphous mass of several shapes to be more precise. \n\n\u201cShe can\u2019t fucking stand kids!\u201d he screamed. \u201cGet her out so I can put her back to sleep!\u201d\n\nA face emerged from the formless mass behind him; a distorted and monstrous parody of female features, mouth agape in a horrible, sickening pose. I froze, paralyzed by the utter shock of what I was seeing, and I even think Ambrosia shut up for a brief second or two.\n\n\u201cWhah,\u201d I muttered. \u201cWhat the heck is that?\u201d\n\n\u201cGet out!\u201d Klaus yelled, still facing Ambrosia and me. \u201cGet out before it\u2019s too late!\u201d\n\nI suppose it was too late, because moments later the corridor was filled with his tormented screams as the horrible face lunged forward, violently biting down on his remaining foot with ferocious force, immediately sending him face down on the floor.\n\n\u201cNo, mother! Please!\u201d Klaus shrieked hysterically, blood squirting from the wound, painting the dull brick walls in a crimson red.\n\nBut she didn\u2019t stop, not even for a second. Just kept chomping down on the poor, helpless Klaus. I wish I could tell you that I did something. Anything. But as the full shape of that repulsive horror slowly revealed herself, I stumbled back, Ambrosia in arm, edging into the wall on the opposite side. \n\nThe gruesome head was on one end of an impossibly long intestinal tract, the abhorrent, greyish serpentine figure ending in an enormous bulbous sack, more than likely functioning as a stomach. Grotesque blackish veins pulsated rhythmically on the beings hideous, leathery skin, and it was almost completely covered in deep fissures, like open, gangrenous wounds. Klaus kept screaming for minutes, until his head finally disappeared into the impossible depths of the gaping mouth, and I could hear a sickening crunch as she cracked him open, chunks of brain and bones and flesh dripping down on the floor. \n\n\u201cWhat on earth is going on here?\u201d Larry suddenly queried, his awkward appearance the last thing I\u2019d expect to see down there. He adjusted his ridiculously overpriced spectacles and squinted down the corridor confusedly.\n\n\u201cHold Ambrosia!\u201d I yelled, throwing him our darling little girl. Larry fumbled to catch her, and somehow managed to grab hold of her before she tumbled to the floor. I gripped onto the gardening shears with both hands, and ran down the corridor howling like a banshee. I must have taken the creature by surprise, because she didn\u2019t even flinch as I brutally stabbed her through a revolting, bulging eye.\n\nThe whole of her utterly disgusting body fell to the floor like a limp sack of flour, spasming violently for minutes. And then...nothing. Nothing but silence, and the sound of poor Larry whimpering, and Ambrosia trying to comfort him.\n\n\u201cI think,\u201d Larry murmured in between pathetic sobs, \u201cI think we have to move now.\u201d\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nLarry was right of course. We couldn\u2019t stay there after what had happened. But we also knew that the value of our house would drop drastically because of the rather unusual demise of our beloved neighbor, and the subsequent investigation into the bizarre existence of his serpentine maternal figure. \n\nSo that\u2019s why we decided to cover the whole thing up.\n\nWe cleaned up the house as best we could, and buried the bodies in the backyard. It was the best course of action all things considered, and in the end everything worked out great for our little family. We sold the house above asking price, found ourselves a new home a few weeks later, and truth be told, we\u2019ve never been happier.  \n\nOur new neighbor is an oddball though. I guess we attract those. Or maybe it\u2019s the other way around? Regardless, Bertrand, our next-door neighbor, plays the violin. I guess that\u2019s a job. Or rather, I should say he *played* the violin. There was a mishap you see. An accident. Just a few weeks after we moved in.\n\nCan\u2019t play the violin with only one arm, I\u2019m [afraid.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Obscuratio/)", "comments": [{"id": "fmobb28", "author": "peculi_dar", "body": "Wow, Karen, are you for real?
