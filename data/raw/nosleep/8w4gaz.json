She's been saying the most horrible things recently...", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/8w4gaz/my_girlfriend_talks_in_her_sleep_shes_been_saying/", "subreddit": "nosleep", "author": "RyanMatthews_", "text": "I\u2019m infatuated with her. \n\nUtterly infatuated.  \n\nAnd it wasn\u2019t at a healthy level.  Far from it.  I would think about her every moment she was away.  I would sometimes sit on my couch and just stare at my phone waiting for her to text.  I\u2019d tell myself \u201cDon\u2019t contact her.  *Don't*.   It will come off as too strong.\u201d  But then I\u2019d still find myself clicking her name on my contact list before my inner voice would continue, \u201cYou don\u2019t want her to know how desperately smitten you are with her.  It\u2019s unattractive.  It will scare her off.  No, you must wait for her to call you this time.\u201d\n\nBut it was excruciating and exhausting.  Almost unbearable.  I once heard that the ancient Greeks believed that falling madly and irrationally in love with somebody was a curse that you would wish upon your enemies.  I could never understand what they meant.  After all, isn\u2019t falling head over heels in love the ultimate goal nowadays?  But now that it\u2019s happened to me, I have to say\u2026 the ancient Greeks were right.  This is a curse.  I was barely in control of myself.  Almost as though my infatuation with her had\u2026 possessed me.\n\nThe two of us were sexually active together but still in the \u201cdating\u201d phase.  We were at that make or break era of a blossoming relationship where we\u2019d either have \u201cthe talk\u201d and formally be in a relationship or we\u2019d start to slowly drift apart.  The latter of which I don\u2019t think I\u2019d be able to cope with.  Honestly, I wouldn\u2019t be able to.  Almost everything about her captivated me.  The way she held her hand over her mouth when she laughed.  How she\u2019d caress the pendant of her necklace when she was frightened.  How she\u2019d twirl her hair in her finger when she was excited.   All of it.  Her smell.  Her smile.  Her eyes.  \n\nYeah, I know.  It probably makes you sick reading about it.  I feel the same way.  I was never the hopeless romantic type.  But now I can\u2019t stop fantasizing about her.  I\u2019d think about us doing the long three-hour hike up to that magnificent view from one of our first dates.  To that first kiss, as we overlooked the lights of the city.  But this time I\u2019d get down on one knee, bring out the ring, and\u2026 well\u2026 you know what would happen next.  \n\nAlright, fine.  I\u2019ll stop.  Yes, this is a girl I\u2019d only been casually dating for a couple of months.  I shouldn\u2019t be thinking about proposing yet.  I know that.  I'm just barely able to control myself any longer.  I feel as though I\u2019m losing power over the decisions I make. \n\nAnd that brings me to why I\u2019m here writing this out at the moment.  It started with the first real thing that troubled me about her. We\u2019d never actually spent a night together.  No matter how late she was over, once either of us showed signs of being tired, she\u2019d up and leave.  She wouldn\u2019t leave awkwardly or in anger. Just a casual kiss good night, a smile, and a \u201ccall me soon\u201d. \n\nIt was something I didn\u2019t really even notice the first few times she did it.  But after almost 8 weeks of dating, it was becoming strange.  I\u2019d have to ask her about it.\n\nIt took drinking almost an entire bottle of wine before I had the courage to do it.  She looked almost defeated when I asked and lowered her eyes in embarrassment.  \u201cI knew this talk would come eventually,\u201d She started.  She took in a deep breath with a long drawn out exhale.  \u201cRecently\u2026.\u201c  she paused again.  \u201cI\u2019ve started talking in my sleep.\u201d  She shook her head in embarrassment.    \u201cIt\u2019s called somniloquy, I looked it up.\u201d  \n\nI shrugged and laughed out loud.  My demeanor seemed to say \u201cThat\u2019s it?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, Stephen\u2026 listen\u201d she said.  She wasn\u2019t laughing.  \u201cIt\u2019s bad.  It\u2026 It\u2019s completely out of control.  It\u2019s not just random words or gibberish.  No.  It\u2019s horrible.  I say horrible disgusting things.\u201d  She was starting to raise her voice, breath heavy,  and tear up.\n\nI approached her and held her.  I told her it couldn\u2019t be that bad.  I told her to spend the night.  I told her she was probably exaggerating.  \n\nI was wrong.\n\nThat night she stayed at my house.  But she warned me of something before falling asleep.  \u201cWhatever you do, don\u2019t wake me up.  It makes me really scared and disoriented if that happens.  And don\u2019t respond to me.  Just ignore it.\u201d  I nodded and agreed.   \u201cIf it becomes too much,\u201d she continued, \u201cjust leave the room and sleep on the couch.  I won\u2019t mind.\u201d\n\nI told her not to worry about it. I told her that it wouldn\u2019t be a big deal.  I told her I wouldn\u2019t leave to the couch.  I\u2019d stay beside her in the bed.\n\nBut I was wrong.\n\nI couldn\u2019t even last one night.\n\n***\n\nWe both fell asleep without incident.  I don\u2019t know how many hours passed, but I woke up in the dark with the sensation that someone was watching me.  And then I remembered\u2026 *She* was with me.  She was actually spending the night.  I smiled.\n\nBut then I noticed the shadowy outline of her sitting up on the bed.  She was looking down at me.  Staring.  \n\nIt creeped me out.  I\u2019ll admit it.  Her posture was entirely different.  It was as though it wasn\u2019t even her at all.\n\nThen she spoke.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t her voice that I heard.  It was much lower and gravelly.  Like something out of a horror movie.\n\n\u201c*I\u2019ll chew the skin from your bones.*\u201d  She said.\n\nI froze. \n\nAt first, I just kept looking at her.  This was not at all what I expected.  I thought it would be more like the way Tourette\u2019s is often portrayed.  Just random swearing and shouting.   I honestly thought to myself\u2026 what will I do if she attacks me right now?  What if she really does try to chew the skin from my bones?  \n\nBut then she just lied down and went back to sleep.\n\nI was creeped out.  I tried to lie back down and ignore her but struggled.  I couldn\u2019t even close my eyes without thinking \u201cMaybe she\u2019s sitting up again and staring at me.\u201d  And then one time I rolled over to look at her\u2026and she *was*.\n\nHer face was pressed right towards mine.  Her breath was foul and rotted.  Something that was most certainly not normal for her.  She spoke again, in the same voice as before.\n\n\u201c*If you don\u2019t move to the couch, you\u2019ll be dead by morning.*\u201d\n\nThat did it for me.  I sat up in a moment and headed for the living room.\n\nShe made some sort of wheezing sound as I left.  I think it was supposed to be laughter.\n\nI was lying on the couch, but I wasn\u2019t going to be able to fall back to sleep.  I was far too shaken.\n\nI was staring out towards the window, hoping to see the first few hints of the sun rising.\n\nAnd then I thought I heard something.  From the bedroom.\n\nI listened.\n\nAnd then I heard it again. \n\n\u201c*Stephen.*\u201d   It was that same low and gravelly voice. It sounded like a witch. \n\nI tried to just ignore it at first.  But then it continued. \n\n\u201c*Stephen.*\u201d  \n\nStill I said nothing.  \n\n\u201c*I know you can hear me, Stephen.  You\u2019re awake now.  Why don\u2019t you come back into the bedroom?*\u201d\n\nThe voice barely sounded human.  \n\n\u201c*Or maybe you\u2019d prefer if I come to **you**?*\u201d\n\nI still didn\u2019t say anything.  I was told not to.  But I listened.  If I heard her start walking towards the bedroom door, I\u2019m not even joking, I would have run right out of the apartment. But she had asked me not to respond to her sleep talking.  So I didn\u2019t.\n\nAnd then I heard her once more.\n\n\u201c*Sorry if this spoils your plans.*\u201d   She began laughing.  \u201c*The two of you were supposed to walk that trail again.*\u201d she started.  I wasn\u2019t even remotely prepared for what she\u2019d say next.\n\n \u201c*You\u2019d both be so tired when you\u2019d reach the top.  You\u2019d look over the city.  Then you\u2019ll get on one knee, and bring out the ring.*\u201d  She began laughing. \n\nAnd that\u2019s when I realized this wasn\u2019t just a problem with sleep talking.  It was something much more.  Something supernatural.  I had never told anybody about my proposal fantasy.  There was simply no way she could have known about any of it.\n\nThis was no longer about merely talking in ones\u2019 sleep.  This was about possession. I can\u2019t go back into the bedroom.  I have no idea what would happen if I did.  Instead, I\u2019m going to wait it out, holding up in my living room until the sun rises.  I have a couple more hours yet.  I can hear her laughing occasionally in the bedroom. It\u2019s still not her voice. Still that same low pitch cackle.\n\nBut as I sit on my couch writing this out, here\u2019s what scares me the most\u2026\n\nMaybe my infatuation and utter obsession with her wasn\u2019t normal.  I said before that I felt like I was losing control of myself.  More so I believe than the typical falling in love story.  No.  I fear that the infatuation I felt was the entity slowly taking control of *me*.  Of it controlling my thoughts, fears, ambitions, and anxieties.  Maybe once I become completely absorbed, a transfer would occur, and she would be free of it. \n\nI know I should leave.  That I should open the front door, get in my car, and drive away from here.  But I can\u2019t. I can\u2019t leave her.  I\u2019ve already lost control.\n\nI\u2019m infatuated with her.\n\nUtterly infatuated.", "comments": [{"id": "e1ssepc", "author": "Nightmare_Pasta", "body": "you should've talked back ina creepier voice\n\n\"I will cook you alive and use your bones for my soup\""}, {"id": "e1sy5sc", "author": "Four-SidedTriangle", "body": "Nah man, go over to her, grab her firmly, and headbutt that shit right outa her"}, {"id": "e1syx44", "author": "LyriumDreams", "body": "Damn, that was creepy.
