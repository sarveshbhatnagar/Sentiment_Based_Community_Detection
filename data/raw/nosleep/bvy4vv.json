If we leave our vehicles we will die.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/bvy4vv/weve_been_stuck_in_construction_traffic_for_8/", "subreddit": "nosleep", "author": "nslewis", "text": "Lauren is in the Honda Accord right behind my truck, with our two cats, but I can\u2019t get out and see her. The last guy who got out was shot in the legs and then run over by a tank.\n\nWe set out yesterday from Gainesville, Florida, where Lauren had recently graduated from law school. We were moving to my home state of Maine, to start a permanent life together. The drive was beautiful most of the way, and Lauren and I spent a lot of time on speaker phone with each other to comment on it. A couple of times we passed through rain, and once a really wild thunderstorm that lit up the whole sky for miles. Then, about 8 hours ago, we hit a traffic jam on I-95 just outside of Lewiston, Maine.\n\nI took a look at the navigation thing on my phone, but it didn\u2019t show any red areas of heavy delay. It also had some trouble showing my exact location, though, so I lit a cigarette and figured it would just be a few minutes.\n\nAfter about fifteen minutes, I called Lauren. \u201cHow\u2019s it going back there?\u201d I asked. In the background, I could hear the cats going nuts.\n\n\u201cNot great,\u201d said Lauren. \u201cDo you hear Hankie and Hattie howling? They started up as soon as we stopped. What's going on?\u201d\n\n\u201cMust be an accident that just happened. My phone usually gives a heads up if there\u2019s planned construction or something.\u201d I heard one of the cats hiss while the other one yowled.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m so tired,\u201d said Lauren.\n\n\u201cI know, me too. Let\u2019s stop and get something to eat once we\u2019re through, yeah?\u201d\n\n\u201cOkay.\u201d\n\n\u201cAlright. Love you. Sorry about the cats.\u201d\n\n\u201cLove you,\u201d said Lauren.\n\nI hung up and tried to get something on the radio. I have a base model 2006 Toyota Tundra, so no AUX jack, and the CD player had broken years ago. During the entire trip, I had been at the mercy of radio stations, and for the most part, they didn\u2019t do much for me other than create a general atmosphere of annoyance.\n\nNow, though, I couldn't even keep the radio on. What wasn't warbling static was some kind of distorted robotic voice reading off a list of numbers and random words strung together. Across the whole radio band, same thing. I couldn't take it so I shut it off.\n\nI picked my phone back up and went to check Twitter. All I got was that game where you have to jump the dinosaur over cacti faster and faster and then it gets dark out and the birds come. No internet. Finally, Twitter did half-load, so there was *some* intermittent reception there, barely.\n\nAfter a half hour had passed, I started to get antsy, and so did everyone else. People were sticking their heads out the window to try to see what was going on, but it was no use. The line of cars seemed endless. A few people got out of their vehicles to try to get a better look. I got out too and started walking to Lauren\u2019s car.\n\nWhen I was halfway there, a voice cut into the air. It sounded like someone shouting through a bullhorn. \u201cReturn immediately to your vehicles! No one is permitted to be outside! This is your only warning. If you do not heed it, there will be severe consequences.\u201d\n\n\u201cWha da *fuck* is goin\u2019 on?!\u201d some guy shouted in a thick Boston accent; he was standing a few car lengths in front of me. An instant later, he was down on the ground, not moving. I didn\u2019t see what happened exactly, but that was enough to make me to hustle back to my truck.\n\nI tried calling Lauren again. When she answered all that I could hear were broken flashes of the cats screaming and Lauren sounding scared and begging to know what was happening.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d I said, not sure that she could hear it. \u201cMaybe they\u2019re searching for a criminal or something. I don\u2019t know.\u201d Then we were disconnected.\n\nA minute later, an ambulance was wailing its way down the right hand shoulder. It stopped just past my truck, and two EMTs jumped out of the back. They closed the doors behind them, but I saw that there was somebody else in there. Somebody dressed in riot gear, holding a big gun.\n\nThe EMTs dragged the guy with the Boston accent by the arms over to the ambulance. They opened the doors and sort of tossed him in, and then followed behind. I saw the riot gear person again for a second, and then the doors slammed shut and the ambulance sped off down the shoulder out of sight.\n\nSomebody four cars ahead of me got the idea to follow the ambulance out of there. I watched as a red Hyundai Sonata with a New Jersey license plate tore into the shoulder lane and sped after the ambulance.\n\nI tried calling Lauren to ask her if she thought we should try it too. It was a ballsy move for sure, but she had sounded at the end of her rope stuck in there with our wailing cats, so I thought she might be willing to give it a shot. This time, the call didn\u2019t even go through.\n\nI was getting ready to try calling again when I heard this loud blast. A puff of smoke blossomed somewhere up ahead, and all of a sudden, there were chunks of a car flying through the air. A red car. Very likely a red Hyundai Sonata.\n\nAs I watched a flaming tire roll to a stop against the highway divider, I decided not to replicate New Jersey\u2019s maneuver.\n\nI heard the blast of a horn behind me, and looked in the rearview to see that Lauren had her arm out the window, moving her hand around in a circle. Finally, it hit me that she was telling me to roll down my window, so that\u2019s what I did.\n\n\u201cCan you hear me?\u201d she shouted.\n\n\u201cI can!\u201d I could even hear the cats. They sounded really freaked out.\n\n\u201cWhat is happening?!\u201d she asked.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know baby! I think we\u2019re in some kind of military lockdown maybe! I think we have to just sit tight here.\u201d\n\n\u201cCan you throw me a bottle?\u201d asked Lauren.\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\n\n\u201cA bottle! Like Gatorade or something. I know that you\u2019ve probably got ten of them in your front seat.\n\nIt was true. Not ten exactly, but close enough. I just threw all of my trash on the seat of my truck until it started overflowing, whereas Lauren kept her car clean. \u201cWhat are you going to do with the bottle?\u201d I asked.\n\n\u201cNot something I want to shout out for the whole world to hear!\u201d said Lauren. \u201cLet\u2019s just say we\u2019ve been here a while and I don\u2019t think we\u2019re coming to a rest stop soon enough.\u201d\n\nFinally, I understood. I reached over and grabbed a bottle. I chucked it out the window, but it was a bad throw, and bounced off the hood of Lauren\u2019s Honda. I tried again, and this time she caught it. She rolled up her window and in the rearview mirror I watched her fuss around as she presumably tried to pee into the thing.\n\nThis was when the fleet of massive trucks started rolling in, on the southbound side of the highway divide. Some of them had cranes sitting on long flat beds, and others had big chunks of some kind of metal material. Soon, the southbound side was jammed up with these giant trucks and their haul. Then they started to get to work.\n\n\u201cWhat are they doing?!\u201d asked Lauren. She\u2019d opened her window back up. \u201cAre they\u2026 building a fucking *wall*?!\u201d\n\nThat is exactly what it looked like they were doing. One crane would take a massive chunk of material, and lift it into place either next to, or on top of, another chunk.\n\n\u201cYes! They\u2019re walling us in!\u201d I shouted. I checked my phone for the thousandth time. I had a bar, and used it to call 911.\n\nA lady answered. \u201cWhat is the address for this emergency?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2026 uh\u2026 I-95 northbound, just before Lewiston, Maine. I forget the exit number we were coming up on. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s okay. What is the emergency?\u201d\n\n\u201cWell\u2026 we\u2019re in this weird traffic jam\u2026 and\u2026 people are dying here. Cars are exploding. They\u2019re building a wall around us. They\u2019re trapping us here. I know that sounds crazy\u2026.\u201d\n\nThere was a long silence on the other end. I thought maybe we\u2019d been disconnected. But then I heard her voice again, crystal clear.\n\n\u201cSir, I am going to need you to remain calm and stay in your vehicle. And if you would, roll down your window. Not the driver\u2019s side, the passenger\u2019s side.\u201d\n\n\u201cW\u2026 what?\u201d I asked. Then I heard the tapping at my window. There was a lady cop standing there, holding a cell phone up to her ear. My heart jumped up into my throat, and my instinct was to slam my foot on the gas pedal, but there was nowhere to go. I rolled down the window.\n\n\u201cYou reported an emergency?\u201d asked the cop. \u201cEverything looks okay to me. We don\u2019t discourage anyone from calling emergency services if they truly think that there might be an emergency situation occurring, but everything appears to be perfectly fine here. I will give you the benefit of the doubt this time, but remember that we also very strongly frown upon fraudulent 911 calls. You could be charged for that, sir. It\u2019s no joke.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh,\u201d I said, trying to hold it together. \u201cI\u2019m sorry about that. I *did* think that something bad was going on, but now I see that everything is okay. Thanks for checking in.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s no problem at all, sir,\u201d said the cop, smiling. \u201cAnd remember: *stay in your vehicle*.\u201d\n\n\u201cOf course,\u201d I said, trying to smile, though I\u2019m sure my face looked like a sweaty pretzel instead.\n\nThe cop nodded and then walked off down the line of cars. I waited a few minutes, and then called out to Lauren.\n\n\u201cI think we\u2019re fucked!\u201d I said. \u201cI called 911 and that cop that was just here? She\u2019s the one who picked up. She said everything\u2019s fine\u2026 but it\u2019s not.\u201d\n\n\u201cFuck!\u201d said Lauren. \u201cWhat do we do?!\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s when the guy jumped out of his car and made a break for the wooded area to the right of the highway. And that\u2019s when they shot him in the legs. I heard him cry out and watched him hit the ground. I heard a loud continuous rumble, interspersed with snaps from the woods. Then I saw the tank. It didn\u2019t so much emerge from the woods as it destroyed the woods in its wake. Beyond it, I saw another enormous wall. We were walled-in from two sides\u2026 and my guess was that we were walled-in from four sides.\n\nThe tank crushed the man like he was a particularly small ant.\n\n\\*\n\nThey are working on the roof now. It's almost done. Once the roof is on, I have a feeling that I won't get any reception at all. Before that happens, I'm hoping for one more spike so that I can get this post out.\n\nI don't know if this is on the news or not. I thought it was just a traffic jam, so that's probably how they're playing it off. They probably have rerouted traffic around us by now.\n\nI don't know what this is. But there are now dozens of heavily armed people in riot gear going from car to car. Sometimes they drag somebody out, and carry them screaming off to what remains of the wooded area, where they disappear from sight.\n\nThey're almost at my truck now. I hope they skip me, and Lauren. Oh God. I'm going to tell her that I love her.\n\nIf this reaches you, I don't know what you can do, but please try to help us.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Part 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/bxoscy/we_were_stuck_in_construction_traffic_for_8_hours/)\n\n[Part 3](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/byqo1k/we_were_stuck_in_construction_traffic_for_8_hours/)", "comments": [{"id": "eptkyh1", "author": "whyshouldyouwakeup", "body": "It's good you have this in writing because it's pretty likely you won't remember a thing once the perpetrator has been detained.
