No sex.* \n\nIt sounded too good to be true, but, as a broke university student, I was willing to take my chances. I swiped right, and Tinder let me know it was a match. His message came seconds later. \n\n**Hey, there sweetheart :)**\n\nI cringed at that word, I hated it, but seven hundred dollars was seven hundred dollars, so I sucked it up and replied. \n\n**Hey ;)** \n\nHis name was Jack, and he told me he owned his own business, although he never specified what kind of business it was. We talked for a while before he asked me for my Venmo to send me the first payment. \n\nAfter a few minutes, I got the notification. I stared at the $700 for at least twenty minutes, expecting to wake up from a dream at any second. But it wasn\u2019t a dream. \n\n**You still there?** \n\nI clicked on the message. \n\n**Yeah. Sorry. If you don\u2019t mind me asking, what are you looking for in return?** \n\nI stared at the chat until he replied. \n\n**I\u2019m just looking for you to do a few favors for me :)**\n\nThat sounded like it was going to be sexual to me. \n\n**Like what?**\n\n**For example, the first thing I need you to do is pick up a delivery for me.** \n\nThat sounded innocent enough, but I was still expecting there to be some kind of twist. Seven-hundred dollars to pick up a package? Come on, even I wasn\u2019t that naive. \n\n**From the post office or something?** \n\n**No.  I\u2019ll send you the address, but I\u2019d rather not do this through Tinder. You got Kik? Or you can give me your number.**\n\nKik? What was this, 2011? I decided to give him my number instead, and he texted me the address immediately, followed by the address to his house, where I would have to drop off the package. \n\n**I\u2019m not home right now, but there\u2019s a key on the bottom of the blue flower pot near the door. Go inside and put the package on the coffee table in the living room. Make sure that you lock the door when you go inside the house, and then lock it again when you leave.** \n\nI grabbed my car keys and wallet and got into my car, putting the address into Google maps. \n\n**Got it! Omw.** \n\nMy phone buzzed as I backed out of my driveway. \n\n**I\u2019m serious. Lock the door BOTH times. Please.** \n\nI thought that was a little excessive, but I promised him that I would. \n\nThe house looked abandoned. It had a broken chain link fence around it, with a small door that was hanging onto dear life. It stuck out like a sore thumb, surrounded by houses that were a lot nicer than this one in comparison. \n\n\u201cYou here for Jack\u2019s shit?\u201d\n\nI looked up to see a man standing in the open doorway of the house. He took up almost the entire space, his head skimming the top of the door frame. He was huge; in height and muscles, and his entire torso was covered in tattoos. \n\n\u201cUh, yeah. I guess.\u201d I replied, not moving from my spot on the sidewalk. \n\n\u201cStay right there.\u201d He said. \n\nI did. I actually don\u2019t think I would have moved if he had asked me to. I looked around and realized that there was no one else on this street. I was a twenty-one-year-old woman alone in the street. I gripped my car keys. \n\nA few minutes later, the man came back out carrying a cardboard box. It was about the size of a shoebox, but stained and damp on some of the corners. \n\n\u201cCan you open your car?\u201d He asked. \n\nI opened the trunk, not wanting that inside on my car seats and he set it in. \n\n\u201cAlright, there you go.\u201d He said. \n\n\u201cThanks.\u201d I replied. \n\nI walked around to the driver's side of the car and opened the door. \n\n\u201cOh, and one more thing!\u201d He said. \n\nI looked at him. \n\n\u201cWatch out.\u201d He said. \n\nI didn\u2019t reply. \n\nI blasted my music as I drove to Jack\u2019s house, hoping it would drown out my anxiety. It didn\u2019t. \n\nI parked my car in the stone driveway and stayed inside the car, admiring the house. \n\nIt was a *huge* house; with stone pillars on the front porch, and the greenest grass I had ever seen in my life. I turned the car off and got out. I grabbed the package, and walked to the front door, getting the key from where he said it would be. \n\nI opened the door and stepped in, closing it behind me. \n\nI thought about what he had said, about locking the door when I got inside. I thought that was a little overboard, but as I stared at the closed door something made me reach out and lock it. \n\nI walked inside, my feet cushioned by the thick maroon carpet, and admired the inside of the house. All the furniture was wooden and looked incredibly expensive. I would probably finish school a dozen times with the money that it took to furnish this place. \n\nI set the package down on the coffee table, and as I walked back to the door, I heard a phone ringing from somewhere inside the house. I froze. \n\nIn my pocket, my phone buzzed. I took it out to look. \n\n**Don\u2019t answer any calls that aren\u2019t from Marvin.** \n\nI put my phone back and followed the sound of the phone, poking my head into a few different rooms before I found it in an office. \n\nI walked over to the desk and looked at the caller ID. \n\n*Incoming call from Jack.* \n\nThat was odd. \n\nI grabbed my phone to look at the message again. I was starting to get a little bit creeped out and decided I wouldn\u2019t answer, just to be safe, and left the house, remembering to lock the door as I left. \n\nI\u2019ve done a few more favors for Jack since then. I drove a BMW to a random park in another city, only to get out and drive a different car back to Jack\u2019s house. He had me meet one of his \u201cemployees\u201d at lunch, who then gave me a briefcase to deliver to the first house I had gone to and told me he would know if I looked inside. On several occasions, he asked me to drive down to that same house and stay with the guy, whose name was Julio, for a certain amount of time.\n\nIn total, I\u2019ve made around $3500. \n\nMost recently, Jack asked me to stay in his house overnight. I woke up to a text message from him. \n\n**I need you to spend the night at my house.** \n\nI hadn\u2019t ever seen him in person, but I had talked to him on the phone a few times. He proceeded to tell me he would pay me $1000 to spend the night at his house, provided that I followed a few rules. \n\nI drove to his house that evening. The driveway was empty, and it normally was, but the porch light was on. I walked up, unlocked the door, went inside and then locked it again. \n\nEverything in the house looked the same. Jack had told me over the phone that he would leave the list of rules on the dining room table. I set all my stuff down in the living room. My bags looked like garbage compared to the fancy furniture in there. \n\nI wandered into the kitchen, and then to the dining room. Sure enough, there was a piece of paper on the wooden table, held down by an empty glass. \n\n*Lock the door when you come in.* \n\n*Only answer calls from Marvin.* \n\n*Don\u2019t turn on any faucets between 9 pm and 11 pm.* \n\n*Don\u2019t open the door for anyone- no matter who they say they are- after 10 pm.* \n\n*If the door to the closet at the end of the hall is open, sleep in the library. If closed, sleep in any of the bedrooms.* \n\n*The gardener comes at midnight. If he starts knocking on the windows, hide.* \n\n*Turn the tv on and let it play on static through the night. DO NOT FORGET TO DO THIS.* \n\n*Help yourself to anything in the fridge. :)*\n\n*I\u2019ll pay you in the morning. Goodnight!*\n\nI made sure to follow all the rules. To be honest, I was regretting my decision. But, seeing as I was already here, and I was getting paid, I decided to stay anyway. I figured as long as I followed all the rules, I\u2019d be perfectly fine. \n\nStill, it felt a little odd. What was this? A haunted house?\n\nNevertheless, I lounged around the house for a few hours, as I was planning on going to sleep around nine since that\u2019s the time that all the weird shit would begin to happen. At 8:50, I brushed my teeth, using the faucet for the last time before 9. \n\nI checked the closet in the hallway and upon seeing that it was open, I moved my stuff into the library and got ready to sleep on the couch. I locked to doors just in case, and laid on the couch, scrolling through my phone. I hadn\u2019t gotten any more messages from Jack, and I started to think up scenarios and reasons as to why he had such strict, peculiar sets of rules in his house. \n\nI had dozed off at some point because, at exactly 10:16 pm, I was woken up by the doorbell ringing. I was about to get up to check, but then I remembered the rule. \n\n*Don\u2019t open the door for anyone- no matter who they say they are- after 10 pm.* \n\nI stayed on the couch, trying not to move, paranoid that they would hear even the slightest sound. \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the police! Open up.\u201d \n\nI didn\u2019t move. \n\n\u201cHello? It\u2019s the police! Open up or we\u2019re coming in.\u201d\n\nI still didn\u2019t move, but I could hear my heartbeat in my ears. \n\nThere was silence for a while after that. \n\nThen the doorbell rang again. \n\n\u201cHey, it\u2019s Jack! Let me in!\u201d\n\nIt sounded like Jack, but still, I didn\u2019t get up. He would have a key, wouldn\u2019t he? Why would he need me to let him in?\n\nThis continued for almost a full hour; different people would ring the doorbell, announce themselves, and then disappear when I didn\u2019t respond. \n\nI was finally able to fall asleep, and the gardener never came. \n\nWhen I woke up the next morning, I heard someone in the kitchen. I got up slowly, and unlocked the door as quietly as possible, taking my phone with me and walking across the living room and into the kitchen. \n\nI stopped at the entrance and peered in. \n\nIt was Jack. He was standing in front of the stove, stirring something as the coffee machine brewed coffee on the counter behind him. \n\n\u201cHey! Good morning!\u201d He said when he saw me. \n\n\u201cHi.\u201d I replied, nervous. \n\nI hadn\u2019t seen him in person before, but he looked exactly like his pictures online. \n\n\u201cScrambled eggs?\u201d He asked, motioning to the pan with a wooden spoon. \n\n\u201cYeah, thanks!\u201d I replied, walking over to take the plate from him. \n\nI ate my breakfast and drank some coffee in silence. \n\n\u201cSo how was it?\u201d He asked. \n\n\u201cIt was okay. Nothing super freaky happened.\u201d I replied. \n\n\u201cCool!\u201d He replied.\n\nThere was an awkwardness in the room. \n\n\u201cI think I\u2019m gonna go now. I have class\u2026\u201d I trailed off. \n\nI didn't. But I really wanted to get out of there. \n\n\u201cOh, no! Yeah, sure! I\u2019ll talk to you some other time.\u201d He replied. \n\nI grabbed my stuff and he walked me to my car. I could see him standing in the driveway, staring at me as I left. \n\nWhen I got home, I unpacked all my stuff and noticed that I still had the list with me. I sat on my bed and read it again. I felt my body tense up as I realized that I had forgotten something. \n\n*Turn the tv on and let it play on static through the night. DO NOT FORGET TO DO THIS.* \n\n*Turn the tv on and let it play on static through the night. DO NOT FORGET TO DO THIS.* \n\n*DO NOT FORGET TO DO THIS.* \n\nI stared at the words on the page until they lost meaning. \n\nBeside me, my phone buzzed, snapping me back to reality. \n\nIt was the $1000 payment. \n\nI looked at my phone and then back at the list. \n\nMaybe it wasn\u2019t an important step?\n\nAs I was thinking this over, a text from Jack came it. \n\n**I\u2019m not in town right now, I should be back next week, so you\u2019re free from running any more errands for me until then! Just sent the payment, go do something fun ;)**\n\nI stared at the message and read it again. \n\nAnd again. \n\nAnd once more for good measure. \n\n**I\u2019m not in town right now.** \n\nI thought back to this morning, and how Jack was in his house. How he gave me breakfast. \n\n**I\u2019m not in town right now.** \n\nWithin minutes, a new text came in this time from a number that I didn\u2019t recognize. \n\n**Did you forget to do something? ;)**\n\nThe text was followed by a picture of Jack - or, whoever this version of Jack was- standing in front of the tv. \n\nI didn\u2019t respond. \n\nNext came another picture, this one was of the outside of my house. \n\nIt was followed by another text. \n\n**Watch out.**", "comments": [{"id": "f494wab", "author": "OnyxOctopus", "body": "We are hoping our readers have some helpful tips and advice now that things have cooled down a bit!

Jack is that guys supplier or jack owns that trap house,. When you were driving to a location with a car you were asked to get you were taking money to the guy Jack gets his shit from to supply his trap house. And the car you brought back had drugs in it . When you were asked to spend the night you essentially were guarding a large amount of money. Basically he wanted your car to be outside so it looked like there was people inside and no one would try to break in hence the TV . The people that came knocking at night are close friend /neighbor crackhead feeners he avoids or people he knows and has fucked over in the past . This is why he told you about the Gardner too in case they came knocking on the window . In the morning you saw him and he made you some eggs .

I mean if you\u2019re gonna continue working with him just know that you could possibly get into deep shit . There are consequences for your actions and the reason he\u2019s trying to keep his distance from you is because when shit hits the fan he doesn\u2019t want you to be able to point him out . Just tell him your mistake and refund him the money if he asks you for it . Also keep in mind he knows where you live by now and could\u2019ve easily had someone break into your car and put a gps tracker or bug when you spent the night at his house.

When it\u2019s closed, he has something there. He maybe just doesn\u2019t like libraries.
