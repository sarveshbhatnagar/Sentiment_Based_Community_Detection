After boarding I saw that I had an entire row to myself. Take off passed without incident, and soon I was stretched out for a nap across the row. \n\nI slept for a few hours, I don\u2019t know how long, but I woke up to some severe turbulence. It\u2019s possible that the lights in the cabin went out for a moment, but I was so disoriented that it\u2019s hard to say.\n\nI checked my phone to see that it was 4:03 AM, which I figured gave me about an hour until we landed. When I looked out my window, I was shocked to see nothing but wide open ocean. My jaw dropped; there\u2019s obviously no ocean between New York and Los Angeles. \n\nI hit the button to call the flight attendant and spent the next few minutes wracking my brain for a lake that could\u2019ve been possibly been big enough to explain what I was seeing. I jumped when the attendant flipped off the light. She was grinning from ear to ear, and tears were pouring down her cheeks.\n\n\u201cHow can I help you sir?\u201d she asked. \n\nI froze for a moment at her reaction before deciding to just ask my question. \u201cWhere are we? Why does it look like we\u2019re flying over an ocean?\u201d\n\nShe wiped her cheeks to clear the tears, still grinning wildly. \u201cSir, we\u2019ll be landing in about an hour.\u201d\n\n\u201cI, uh, OK, thank you,\u201d I said.\n\nAfter she left I checked the clock on my phone again. 4:03 AM blinked back at me.\n\nIt hadn\u2019t changed. \n\nI had to have been waiting with my call light on for at least five minutes. How was it possible that it hadn\u2019t changed at all?  \n\nI opened up my laptop and saw it too displayed 4:03 AM. I pulled out my phone, started a stopwatch in the app, and spent the next two hours looking back and forth between the clocks, waiting for them to change.\n\nThey never did.\n\nI tapped the shoulder of an older woman sitting in the row ahead of me. She looked back, an annoyed expression across her face. \u201cYes?\u201d she asked. \n\n\u201cDo you know how long until we land?\u201d I asked.\n\nShe narrowed her eyes. \u201cThat flight attendant said it would be about another hour.\u201d\n\nI shook my head in confusion. \u201cThat flight attendant? We talked almost two hours ago! We should\u2019ve landed already.\u201d\n\nShe stared at me as if I was crazy. I was going to continue trying to convince her, but I felt a hand on my shoulder. I spun to see a male flight attendant grinning down at me, tears pinging off his cheeks onto my shoulder. \n\n\u201cSir, I\u2019m going to ask you to calm down, or I\u2019ll be calling the Captain.\u201d\n\nI told him that wouldn\u2019t be necessary and sat back. He removed his hand and stepped away. \n\nThe flight attendants continued to stop by every few hours offering meals. My stopwatch continued to tick up and is now telling me that I\u2019ve been on this plane for more than thirty hours. \n\nI\u2019ve explored all of coach and tried talking to some of the other passengers, but they\u2019ve all told me that they\u2019re expecting to land in an hour or so. \n\nAround three hours ago I tried getting into first class. I made it past the curtain but was escorted back by two grinning flight attendants. Their grip on my arms were like iron. \n\n\u201cSir, the seatbelt sign is on,\u201d one said. \u201cPlease remain in your seat with your buckle fastened. We\u2019ll be landing in about an hour.\u201d\n\nI\u2019d just about given up hope when a woman came down the aisle dressed in a business suit. She didn\u2019t look at me or slow down, but she dropped a piece of paper onto my tray as she made her way to the bathrooms at the back of the plane. \n\nI shot a look around before unrolling it. \n\nIt said, \u201cAre you stuck too?\u201d\n\nI pulled out a pen and wrote \u201cYes. It\u2019s been thirty hours.\u201d\n\nI folded the scrap of paper up and set it on the tray closest to the aisle. She left the bathroom and picked it up as she passed. \n\nIt\u2019s been twenty minutes since then. I don\u2019t know why, but I don\u2019t think the flight attendants would like it if they knew we were talking. It doesn\u2019t matter. I have to do *something*. I\u2019ll update you all with whatever happens next.\n\n[Part 2](https://jamesworchester.com/tales/ive-been-flying-for-almost-thirty-hours-and-the-flight-attendants-wont-stop-crying-part-2/)\n\n[Support](https://www.reddit.com/user/Worchester_St/comments/fegg4z/you_probably_just_clicked_on_my_profile_from_my/)", "comments": [{"id": "f4rmfgt", "author": "frankado", "body": "Even if nothing paranormal was going on, a 30-hour flight still sounds like utter hell."}, {"id": "f4rnkfm", "author": "spartanwanderer", "body": "This is one of those situations where you should probably bite the bullet and pay for the WiFi."}, {"id": "f4r6wex", "author": "shadfly", "body": "This is such a horrifying concept, being stuck in time."}, {"id": "f4scpno", "author": "Thefatpug512", "body": "Maybe that turbulence that woke you up was you guys crashing and your now dead but since you didn\u2019t realize you died your stuck and unable to move on"}, {"id": "f4sel1m", "author": "Anticlimactic__", "body": "I wonder why has the crew been smiling abnormally yet crying at the *same time*?
