The moon seems like the perfect place to find an ocean.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat a shame we never found water then,\u201d I said. \u201cBecause those false seas, astronomers called them \u2018maria.\u2019\u201d\n\nMom smiled. \u201cHow sweet of them to name the moon oceans after me.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, they didn\u2019t find any oceans,\u201d I reminded her.\n\n\u201cMaybe they just didn\u2019t look hard enough,\u201d she replied, a little laugh slipping from her lips.\n\nFor all of the pain she was in, all of the fear she must feel, my mother always had the kind of laugh that could light a candle. We were in her hospital room, the same one we\u2019d been in and out of for the last year and a half. Sometimes we had a roommate, sometimes we were alone. Always she held steady enough for both of us, the rock I tied my hope to, the wall against the grief I knew was coming.\n\nCancer is such a mundane word for something so hungry and cruel. I\u2019ve noticed medicine does that a lot, covers horror with tedious language like a bed sheet over a body.\n\n*Malignant. Inoperable. Metastasized. Terminal.*\n\nBut when she laughed...when she laughed we weren\u2019t in the hospital anymore, we were home. When she laughed, she wasn\u2019t sick, she was young again, and I was a kid, and the world was a bright place begging to be explored. What a miracle my mother was. Cancer had taken so much from her, aged and hurt her, but it could never steal her laugh. That was hers to keep.\n\n\u201cHow are we feeling today?\u201d the doctor asked. He came in less and less often. We could all sense this was the final stay in this room.\n\n\u201cJust brilliant, doc,\u201d my mom said, struggling to sit a little higher. \u201cWe can still go dancing later if you\u2019d like. Though we\u2019ll have to ask for my son\u2019s blessing. Ever since his dad died, Brian\u2019s been very protective of me.\u201d\n\nI put on a stern face. \u201cI\u2019ll need to know your intentions are pure, Dr. Bradshaw.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs the driven snow,\u201d he played along. \u201cBut I might need a raincheck on the dance, Ms. Willen. I\u2019m not as young as I used to be.\u201d\n\nHe emphasized his age, running his fingers through grey-white hair. My mom tapped her bare scalp.\n\n\u201cRight there with you, tiger,\u201d she said.\n\nDr. Bradshaw smiled but I could tell he was burdened. I saw him glance at the small idol I\u2019d placed on my mother\u2019s nightstand. The talisman was a miniature oak tree carved from gray soapstone. There were four faces etched into the tree, a sentry against ill health and bitter spirits. I could tell the stone tree made the doctor uncomfortable. In all honesty, I had a tough time looking at the idol for more than a few seconds. The faces were each whittled in vivid expression. The face closest to my mother\u2019s bed was smiling kindly and the face pointed towards the door was snarling, meant to ward away harm.\n\nThe final two faces were both weeping. All four shapes were too human, too raw. There was a *weirdness* to the stone tree that put people on edge but I\u2019d grown used to every shade of weird you can imagine. My mother\u2019s side of the family was full of stories of unexplained luck and mysterious tragedy, whispered secrets and unexplained deaths. By all accounts, my maternal grandmother was either an honest-to-goodness witch or full-bore, high-caliber crazy, or both. *Probably* both.\n\nThe stone tree was from a box of my grandmother\u2019s things I\u2019d found in the attic earlier that month. Maybe it was just a coincidence, but my mom did seem to get a bit better when I\u2019d brought in the talisman, at least for a little while.\n\nI was daydreaming about family history and the odd box while Dr. Bradshaw checked his charts and mom\u2019s vitals.\n\n\u201cCan I talk to you for a moment?\u201d he asked, ripping me back to reality. Dr. Bradshaw tried to keep a light tone but I could tell he didn\u2019t have good news.\n\nThe hospital hallway smelled like ammonia and birthday cake. Someone must have had a party, maybe a patient, maybe a nurse. Strange how you remember the insignificant details while your world is crashing down around you.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m so sorry,\u201d Dr. Bradshaw told me. \u201cThe results came in this morning. It\u2019s spreading aggressively. We...we held it back as long as we could, Brian. Your mom is a fighter. But right now we just need to, well, to try to keep her as comfortable as we can. Brian?\u201d\n\nThe wall was cracking, grief waiting on the other side, heavy and cold as an empty house. I\u2019d known for months that this was the most likely outcome but it still hurt to hear. Hurt worse than I could stomach.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s nothing left to try?\u201d I asked, fighting down the urge to throw up. \u201cAnything, experimental, untested, anything?\u201d\n\nDr. Bradshaw shook his head. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. Sometimes we just run out of options. She fought a good fight.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow long does she have left?\u201d I asked, looking back into her room. She\u2019d fallen asleep.\n\n\u201cNot long. Maybe days. Have you considered hospice?\u201d\n\nThe smell of ammonia and birthday cake. The steady beep of mom\u2019s heart monitor. I tried to focus on the world around me. My hope wasn\u2019t dead yet. If medicine couldn\u2019t help my mom, maybe something older could. I thought of the box of my grandmother\u2019s things waiting in the attic. There was a lot in there I hadn\u2019t gone through yet, books and candles and secrets and lost things. Maybe there was a cure or at least a way to keep the fight going.\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d I said. \u201cIf all that\u2019s left is to make her comfortable, I want to take her home.\u201d\n\nThe doctor smiled. \u201cI understand. We can give you some medication, ways to help her with the pain.\u201d He put his hand on my shoulder. \u201cYour mom\u2019s been in a lot of pain but she\u2019ll have peace, soon. You\u2019ve done all you can.\u201d\n\n\u201cI know,\u201d I lied. \u201cThank you.\u201d\n\nMom lived in a small ranch house ten miles outside of town. There wasn\u2019t much in the way of neighbors besides some woods and a creek slithering through her yard. It was a windy, warm March afternoon when I took my dying mother home. That night I began my work. I was going to turn the house into a bunker, a maze Death could never solve. I would keep my mother safe, I would find a way to keep her alive.\n\nThe little red book was full of ideas. Running water was an obvious place to start. The creek behind the house was barely a trickle but it should provide some coverage to the south side of the property. Salt was next, lining the doorways and window frames, then in an unbroken circle around the entire house. This step was to be repeated daily, the red book stressed, or even multiple times per day. Even a moderate breeze played holy havoc with any salt poured outside so it was always best to trace and retrace every few hours. Water and salt were common defenses against man\u2019s oldest enemy and well known. The book offered other, less conventional, advice.\n\nIt took me nearly a week to finish carving the symbols and signs into the walls, the floors, even the trees on the property. Sometime around noon on the third day, on my back in the crawlspace etching strange marks onto the underside of the floor, it struck me how ridiculous I was acting. There was no proof that any of the information in the little red book was anything other than the delusional ramblings of a bizarre woman I\u2019d only met once or twice as a child. For all I knew, the runes meant to ward off Death were actually a grocery list written in Cantonese. But I was desperate, and every time I saw my mother she looked frailer, more fragile. So I continued carving and praying and building layers upon layers of protections to keep Death far away.\n\nMaking my marks took me all over the property. It was a big yard, nearly three acres that blended gradually into the surrounding forest. I wasn\u2019t able to pinpoint the exact boundary where cultivated met nature, the edges simply bled together, but I did my best to create a clean border with lines between the symbols. I\u2019d always loved the wildness here, the way you could wander a few hundred yards away from home and feel like you\u2019d traveled hundreds of years into the past to somewhere primal. This was the perfect playground for a kid, whether I was out exploring trails or trapping minnows or spending the summer building yet another treehouse, convinced this would be the final one. It never was, I was never satisfied.\n\nThe house itself, though small, was more than enough room for my mother and me. Dad died when I was seven. I don\u2019t remember much about him, just how big he seemed, with a bonfire grin and arms that I thought could hold the whole world. My mom often said I took after my father. I could see it in the old pictures of him, we had the same eyes, green as moss in the summer, and the same fiery shock of red hair, enemy to every comb on the planet. The sicker mom got the more often she called me by my father\u2019s name. I worried when she drifted away like that but a part of me was proud she\u2019d mistake me for him.\n\nAfter all of the symbols were carved there were a few steps left in the book to deter Death from visiting. There were dozens of charms and talismans in the bottom of the old box in the attic. I sat up there combing through everything my grandmother left behind, referencing the red book, pushing the tiny charms into tidy piles. None of the idols were larger than my thumb. Some were iron and others were wood, some were heavy, others light. All of them were uncomfortable to look at or touch.\n\nThe attic was drafty but not nearly enough to explain the cold that burrowed into me as I sorted the charms. I\u2019m not particularly tall but the attic felt like it was designed for dolls, beams so low I couldn\u2019t even walk bent over. I moved around on my knees, rough floorboards threatening splinters even through my jeans. I could have taken the box downstairs where I\u2019d have more room but the idea filled me with a deep unease. It seemed better to leave the box up in the attic, only taking down objects as I needed them. Up here, at least, my grandmother\u2019s items, her legacy was...quarantined.\n\nThe red book was very specific about the distribution of the totems around the house and property. I walked carefully through my mom\u2019s backyard, boots plopping in and out of mud, compass in hand. It had rained nearly every day since I\u2019d taken my mom home from the hospital. I knew it was almost certainly a coincidence but couldn\u2019t help wonder if the soft curtains of rain falling to the ground were for her. I placed charms in a compass rose with the house in the middle. The most disturbing objects were given places of honor at each cardinal direction.\n\nWater, salt, wards, charms, all placed carefully, intentionally. My grandmother\u2019s book promised that these would offer some degree of protection against the inevitability of Death. The symbols would confuse it, the talismans distract it, and the water and salt make barriers to slow it down. But Death might still find a crack to slip through, so the red book recommended one final trick.\n\nThere was a small candle in the bottom of the box, dirty white as stained paper. When I took the candle from its case the smell made me gag. Have you ever walked past a portable toilet in the dog days of summer? When it\u2019s so hot, the blue plastic has started to warp and bubble? Imagine that smell distilled into a finger\u2019s worth of wax. I brought the candle downstairs, placed it on the dining room table and set it alight.\n\nThe wick caught immediately, the flame burning an unusual red-brown. No heat came off of the candle and it actually seemed cooler the closer I moved my hand to the fire. Once the wax began to melt the smell was ten times worse than it was back in the attic. I choked down a greasy sickness crawling up my throat and quickly left the room, shutting the French doors as I went. That helped trap the odor but I couldn\u2019t shake the sense of nausea. I went to check on my mother.\n\n\u201cDo you remember the day you ran away?\u201d my mom asked, sitting in her bed, lunch untouched on the nightstand beside her.\n\nI didn\u2019t think she had any weight left to lose before she was nothing but bone and memory. Her skin was rice paper over a frame that seemed smaller every day. Her eyes, though, no matter how fragile the rest of her became, remained two little lanterns against the dark, blue and bright and alive.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t make it very far,\u201d I answered. \u201cAnd I wasn\u2019t really running away, only...stretching my legs.\u201d\n\nMom smiled. \u201cYou told me you were leaving for the circus. You wanted to be either a lion tamer or a strongman or maybe a fire-eater.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think I wanted to be all of that combined. Young me was big on multitasking.\u201d\n\nMy mother turned so she was looking out the window into the yard. \u201cI was so scared when I found your note, the one saying you were leaving. My hands were shaking like you wouldn\u2019t believe when I called the sheriff and then Mr. Jonas down the way. It felt like we were searching for you for half the night, even though it couldn\u2019t have been more than an hour before we found you there, lost in the woods, wandering around and shivering. You hadn\u2019t even brought a jacket.\u201d\n\nI sat next to my mom on the bed. \u201cYeah, I didn\u2019t exactly plan ahead for my circus escape. I remember...I remember getting over the idea real quick but I couldn\u2019t find my way back. I\u2019m glad you found me.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m glad, too,\u201d my mother said and I noticed her wipe away a tear. \u201cI\u2019m so glad. That hour you were gone, Brian, that was the most afraid I\u2019ve ever been. Afraid we wouldn\u2019t find you, afraid you might be hurt or worse. I couldn\u2019t hardly breathe through the fear. Then, suddenly, you were there and the relief nearly knocked me over. I think we stayed up together the rest of the night watching the stars. I wanted to make sure you could find the North Star in case you ever got lost again.\u201d\n\nShe turned back to me, reached out her thin hand and placed it over mine. There were still tears in her eyes but she smiled her lighthouse smile and, for a moment, I saw her just as she used to be, just as she was the night I ran away and my mom found me.\n\nI squeezed her hand. \u201cI was scared, too. I was afraid I\u2019d be stuck out there. What made you think of it?\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, I\u2019ve been thinking a lot about dying lately and-\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t,\u201d I interrupted. \u201cDon\u2019t talk like that. You\u2019re not going anywhere, not for a long time.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d she said, squeezing my hand back. \u201cIt\u2019s okay. I\u2019ve known real fear and what I\u2019m feeling now...it\u2019s not like that. I\u2019m scared, I guess, but I\u2019m at peace with it. I had such a beautiful life. I\u2019m so glad I got to meet you, to be your mom.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m glad, too,\u201d I whispered, voice breaking on the last word.\n\n*But I won\u2019t let you go without a fight,* I added silently in my mind.\n\nSomething was trying to get to my mom. The strangeness began the day after I lit the candle. At first it was small blips, tiny *wrongs* that I chalked up to my imagination. Doors I knew I\u2019d closed at night were open in the morning. Food began to rot and spoil within days of me bringing it into the house. Eventually, food would go bad within just a few hours. Every few hours the television in the living room would either turn off if it was running, or on if it was off.\n\nClocks would stop overnight, always at 3:03 am. Shadows began *sticking* to the corners of rooms independent of any light sources. The shadows were stubborn and they would linger for as long as I would stare, then disappear when I blinked. I began hearing bumps and knocks at all hours and sometimes, when I\u2019d enter an empty room, I had a sharp, fleeting certainty that it was only just occupied.\n\nI avoided the dining room except to check in twice a day to see if the candle was still burning. The smell was vicious and would claw its way into your throat and nostrils the moment it was given a chance. I kept the door to the room shut and kept air fresheners running in the surrounding rooms 24/7. The funny thing was, the candle never went out, never even seemed to shrink. I could see the wax melting but day-in and day-out the candle refused to change.\n\nDays marched into weeks and the wrongness only grew deeper. My mom and I both lost sleep to vivid nightmares that we couldn\u2019t remember when we woke up. Only the echoes remained but those were enough to leave my pulse sprinting until morning. I started sleeping in a chair in my mother\u2019s room. I did this to comfort her if she woke up confused during the night but also because, if I\u2019m being honest, I was too scared to sleep alone. I felt like a child running into his parents\u2019 room, convinced there was a monster under the bed. Thing is...maybe there was.\n\nBy the third week I couldn\u2019t keep doors closed. They would slam open the moment I left the room. A terrible scratching began inside of the walls. I told my mom it might be squirrels or mice but the sound was so insistent, not like rodents milling about, more like a dog wanting in. I stopped leaving the house for supplies; instead I had what little food we ate delivered. I kept the curtains drawn. There was tapping on the glass every night.\n\nAbout a month after leaving the hospital we were living like zombies. The dining room couldn\u2019t contain the smell of the candle anymore. The entire house was clogged with the scent. Tiny noises had graduated into full on laughs and screams and whispers in the rooms around us. Something kicked the bathroom door so hard while I was taking a shower that the hinges warped. I covered every mirror in the house. I\u2019d started to see things in the corners looking back at me, half-hidden faces, shapes that skittered away as soon as I turned around. Mom was drifting further and further away. She had long moments of confusion where she\u2019d forget my name, forget where we were. Sometimes, she\u2019d think I was my dad. Other times, she\u2019d just stare at the wall for hours, growing fainter and fainter each day like a Polaroid left in the sun.\n\nBut she was alive.\n\nIt was clear that we were under siege by something. My world shrank to only one room and every trip to the bathroom or to answer the door for food felt like going over the trenches. The noises kept getting worse and worse, the shadows closer, the sense of movement around the house sharper. Every now and then I would feel hot breath on the back of my neck or walk through a cold patch hanging in the air. I stopped bothering redrawing the lines of salt around the house. I knew, deep in my bones, that as long as the sickly candle burned, Death could not take my mom away.\n\nOn the thirty third day after leaving the hospital, I woke with a start from a nightmare, only to find my mom\u2019s bed empty. She hadn\u2019t been able to walk the past week at all, so my first feeling was hope that she might be improving, at least a little. Then I noticed the oder we\u2019d been living with for weeks was gone.\n\n\u201cMom!\u201d I shouted, running in bare feet out of the room.\n\nI found her in the dining room, the door wide open. She was standing at the table, frail as a neglected scarecrow, bobbing back and forth. Her hands were hovering over the candle. The flame was out.\n\n\u201cWhy did you do that?\u201d I whispered. \u201cMom? Mom...are you okay?\u201d\n\nI padded into the room, the wooden floor freezing cold. My mother didn\u2019t react to my presence, she just continued rocking side-to-side. I realized she was still asleep.\n\n\u201cMom?\u201d I gently shook her shoulder. \u201cWake up.\u201d\n\nHer head snapped back and she nearly fell. I caught her on the way down. It felt like she weighed nothing at all.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d she asked, looking around the dark room. \u201cWhere\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re okay,\u201d I told her. \u201cYou were sleepwalking.\u201d\n\n\u201cI was having the most unusual dream,\u201d mom mumbled. \u201cThere were so many stars and...\u201d\n\nShe began to shiver uncontrollably. The cold hit me a moment later. I let out a gasp. The house was chilly before but the dining room was near-arctic. My breath bloomed into a thin cloud in front of my face. I became acutely aware of the complete silence filling the house.\n\nThen I heard scratching. It was coming all throughout the house, deep tearing sounds at the walls around the dining room. Footsteps came immediately after, heavy and fast. Somewhere in the house a window shattered.\n\n\u201cBrian,\u201d my mother said, holding onto me.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry,\u201d I said, \u201ceverything will be-\u201d\n\nMy voice deserted me as a massive shadow unfolded in the corner of the room. It was shaped like a man but tall, so very tall. And it was fast. Before I could yell the shadow was on us, pouring over my mother. In the space of a heartbeat, she was simply gone.\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d I whispered, clawing at the dissolving shadow where my mom used to be. \u201cNo, no, no, no, NO.\u201d\n\nThe shadow was disappearing like a puddle sinking into the floor. There was a texture to it, oily and too slick to hold.\n\nI thought of my mother the night she found me lost in the woods, the night I\u2019d run away. Her face filled my memory, her lighthouse smile. I remembered the relief I felt when she found me, the overwhelming love. I held onto that feeling, clutching it close.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t have her,\u201d I whispered.\n\nI closed my fist around the last threads of the shadow. There was a terrible sensation of *pulling*. It was like I\u2019d caught a horse by the tail and it was trying to shake me. But I held on.\n\nA sense of ripping and being dragged. It was a riptide with a mind of its own. But I held on. It could not shake me.\n\nThe temperature was dropping every second and I felt my vision growing dark. The last thought that ran through my head before I blacked out was a promise to myself that even if I died, my grip would hold. I wouldn\u2019t let my mother\u2019s life slip away. All sounds and light faded, narrowing to a pinprick and then going black.\n\nI woke up under a field of stars. I was lying in soft grass, still wearing my pajama bottoms and an old t-shirt. It was cool, wherever I was, but comfortably so. I stood up. There were trees all around me, tall and close, stitched together with shadows. Immediately to my right, there was a road that ran straight as far as I could see, blurring into the horizon. But the stars, they were like nothing I\u2019d ever seen before.\n\nBright ribbons of northern lights rippled above me in green and blue and purple. Stars lit the sky like millions of lanterns floating on a still ocean. The moon shone sharpest of all, a spotlight hanging above the treeline, so close I thought I could stretch up and brush its face.\n\n\u201c***You are*** ***persistent***,\u201d said a voice from the forest behind me.\n\nI whipped around but couldn\u2019t see anyone. Then a dark spot began to clarify against the gloom. The silhouette separated itself and moved towards me. I recognized it instantly as the shadow from the dining room. As it moved closer, the thing grew and grew until it touched the sky and filled my vision. A deep dread sank into me but I stood my ground.\n\n\u201cGive me back my mom,\u201d I shouted.\n\nThe silhouette pulled away from the sky and then it was standing in front of me, the shape and size of a tall man. But instead of a shadow, the thing had wrapped itself in stars. Miniature constellations drifted across its body, floating slowly like a timelapse of a clear night sky. Burning brightest was the North Star, blue and warm. The space between the stars was absolute black, not a shadow but a complete absence of light. It was the most beautiful, terrifying thing I\u2019d ever seen.\n\n\u201cWhat are you?\u201d I whispered.\n\n***\u201cYou know,\u201d*** it replied.\n\n\u201cGive her back,\u201d I begged. \u201cPlease, give her back.\u201d\n\n***\u201cI can\u2019t. It\u2019s her time. Past her time. You delayed me. Delayed her.\u201d***\n\nI clenched my fists. \u201cShe didn\u2019t get enough time. *I* didn\u2019t get enough time. It\u2019s not right, it\u2019s not fair.\u201d\n\n***\u201cOf course it\u2019s not fair,\u201d*** the starry thing said, ***\u201cbut it is right. You each have your time, and at the end of it, there\u2019s me, and there is a road, and we walk it together.\u201d***\n\n\u201cWhere to?\u201d I asked. \u201cWhere are you taking her?\u201d\n\n***\u201cI don\u2019t know. It\u2019s not for me to know, only to know how to get there.\u201d***\n\n\u201cThen I won\u2019t let you take her.\u201d I planted myself in the road. The world was still and solemn around us. The constellations drifted like clouds and a soft breeze stirred the branches.\n\nThe starry thing didn\u2019t respond for a moment.\n\n***\u201cYour mother was kind and caring. Wherever she goes, she\u2019ll have peace,\u201d*** it promised.\n\n\u201cBut-\u201d\n\nThe creature raised its hand. ***\u201cDid you ever stop to think that death isn\u2019t an enemy? Death simply*** **is.** ***It is the natural partner to life. It knows no prejudice or malice, has no designs or ambitions. Your mother spent so long suffering, felt so much pain. Instead of letting her rest, you took it upon yourself to draw her life beyond its given course. You kept her alive but at the cost of stretching her thin, prolonging her sickness, diluting her. Did you keep her alive for her benefit or for yours?\u201d***\n\nI couldn\u2019t answer.\n\n***\u201cStretching a life is unnatural, dangerous,\u201d*** it told me. ***\u201cIn the weeks you kept me away you drew the attention of old things, hungry things, forces that would like nothing better than to swallow even the memory of your mother, to tear and bite until there was nothing left but pain and fear and a perfect emptiness.\u201d***\n\nI shuddered remembering the clawing sounds, the shattered window, and the laughter from empty rooms.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d I whispered. \u201cAre they...can they hurt her here? Is she safe?\u201d\n\nThe stars in the shadow burned brighter for a moment. ***\u201cYour mother won\u2019t walk her road alone. None of you do. I walk with you, always, to the end.\u201d***\n\n\u201cCan I see her?\u201d I asked. \u201cPlease? Just, I...let me say goodbye.\u201d\n\nIt considered for several seconds. ***\u201cYou are persistent.\u201d***\n\nAnd then the starry thing was gone. I was standing alone on an empty road.\n\n\u201cBrian?\u201d\n\nI turned to find my mother behind me on the road. She looked younger, healthier than I\u2019d seen her in years. The frailty was gone and my mother seemed exactly as I remembered her when she found me in the woods all those years ago.\n\n\u201cIsn\u2019t this the most beautiful dream?\u201d she asked, staring up at the night sky.\n\n\u201cYeah,\u201d I said, trying to keep my voice steady. \u201cA beautiful dream. I love you, mom. I love you so much, so very much.\u201d\n\nShe smiled and touched my cheek. \u201cI love you, too. Don\u2019t cry, it\u2019s okay. I\u2019ll wake up any time now. I\u2019ll see you then.\u201d\n\nI nodded, wiping at tears. \u201cSure, yeah, I\u2019ll see you then.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat do you think is at the end of the road?\u201d she asked. \u201cDo you think I\u2019ll have time to find out before I wake up?\u201d\n\nI looked out at the road, scanning the trees for any hungry shadows. \u201cI don\u2019t know, I don\u2019t know where it goes but...promise me you\u2019ll be careful.\u201d\n\nMy mom smiled wider. \u201cOf course I\u2019ll be careful.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd she won\u2019t walk alone,\u201d said a familiar voice behind us both.\n\nI turned, expecting the starry thing. But the man standing on the road was entirely normal. The light from the moon was enough that I could see he had moss green eyes and a bright shock of red hair.\n\n\u201cSuch a beautiful dream,\u201d my mother said.\n\nThe man came towards us and took my mother\u2019s hand. He and I looked so alike, I could see why my mother confused us when she was sick.\n\n\u201cTake care of her,\u201d I told the man. \u201cI\u2026just please take care of her, make sure she gets where she\u2019s going. There are, well, there are things out there that want her, to hurt her, it\u2019s, it\u2019s my fault, I\u2019m sorry, I\u2019m so sorry-\u201d\n\nThe man squeezed my shoulder. \u201cShe\u2019ll be safe, watched over. If the Devil himself is waiting on the road ahead *he\u2019ll move.* Or he\u2019ll be moved.\u201d\n\nI believed him.\n\nThoughts raced through my head. There were so many things I wanted to say, questions, a million ways to say goodbye. I wanted to stretch out the moment for as long as I could but I realized I\u2019d already delayed my mother enough.\n\n\u201cI love you,\u201d I told them both. \u201cGoodbye.\u201d\n\nI woke up back in my dining room sitting at the table, the unlit candle in front of me. The house was quiet and still. There was no more scratching, no sound or sense of life at all. I walked through every room. The house was empty. I was alone.\n\nI\u2019ve spent the past couple months working on the house, erasing the marks I\u2019d made, fixing up the property. Some nights I take long walks out into the forest. I\u2019m far enough out in the country that on clear nights it\u2019s like looking up at a sea of stars. I think about my parents the most during those walks, I grieve and remember in my own way. And I wonder where their road went, if they\u2019re still traveling or if they reached their destination.\n\nI hope that their road takes them strange and beautiful places. When I walk at night, I look up for the North Star to keep from getting lost. Maybe they do the same.\n\nWhen it\u2019s full, I also look up towards the moon. I wonder if my parents had a chance to visit, to search for hidden oceans. I like to think they did, that the moon has at least one [Maria, the one I love most](https://www.reddit.com/r/Grand_Theft_Motto/).\n\n[Audio](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5wVfBQWuz64&feature=youtu.be)\n\nEDIT: Thank you to everyone who read the story and my heart goes out to every single person that shared their experiences, spoke about their grief, love and family.

I would get occasional glimpses of her if I stayed up late enough, but it was rare. Three months after her diagnosis she was gone. A little over a year ago, I started having a recurring nightmare where I was able to have her back for one day in perfect health, but when night fell she would pass out in my arms, and I would watch her body shrivel like it did when she was sick and then decompose and turn to mush in my hands. The part where you described your mother falling into your arms and turning into a greasy shadow sent chills and what I can only describe as nausea down every part of my body and I almost had to stop reading because of the similarities to my nightmare, but I made myself continue and I ended up finding peace in this story.

Hard. My mom passed away in December, to cancer, after the doctors told us there was simply nothing else to do. I felt like her last dregs of life were like your mother's: frightening, unnatural, and torturous. We had no misunderstandings about her survival, we were just trying to keep her comfortable. We couldn't. 300 mcg of fentanyl patches couldn't. She, I assume like your mother, was in pain until the moment she was able to slip away. I so wish there had been something to do as easy as extinguishing a candle to stop her suffering.\n\n At some point, my dad and I are likely going to use her battle to advocate for allowing terminally ill people to die with dignity and peace. May I use some elements of your story? It brought me to tears because the imagery and metaphors are so apt and they remind me so much of the early days in hospice when we were still fighting. You so succinctly expressed what a futile fight it is to stave off the inevitable, and you hit the nail on the head with the terrors that come with the final stages of dying. I think a story like this - where the problems, fears, and pains are real, tangible, and obvious - would help so many people see why assisted suicide is needed.\n\nThank you for writing the last scene, where her husband protects her on her journey down the road. My dad is still with me, and so I think it was my mom's grandma who protected my mom on her road, just like she protected my mom in life.\n\nToday is my mom's birthday, and the thought of her walking hand in hand with her grandma down a road to paradise is a very nice thought to start the day with. If this was inspired by your experience with your mom battling cancer, I hope you're doing as well as you can. It sucks.
