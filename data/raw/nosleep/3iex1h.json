I've been an SAR officer for a few years now, and along the way I've seen some things that I think you guys will be interested in. \n\n* I have a pretty good track record for finding missing people. Most of the time they just wander off the path, or slip down a small cliff, and they can't find their way back. The majority of them have heard the old 'stay where you are' thing, and they don't wander far. But I've had two cases where that didn't happen. Both bother me a lot, and I use them as motivation to search even harder on the missing persons cases I get called on. \nThe first was a little boy who was out berry-picking with his parents. He and his sister were together, and both of them went missing around the same time. Their parents lost sight of them for a few seconds, and in that time both the kids apparently wandered off. When their parents couldn't find them, they called us, and we came out to search the area. We found the daughter pretty quickly, and when we asked where her brother was, she told us that he'd been taken away by 'the bear man.' She said he gave her berries and told her to stay quiet, that he wanted to play with her brother for a while. The last she saw of her brother, he was riding on the shoulders of 'the bear man' and seemed calm. Of course, our first thought was abduction, but we never found a trace of another human being in that area. The little girl was also insistent that he wasn't a normal man, but that he was tall and covered in hair, 'like a bear', and that he had a 'weird face.' We searched that area for *weeks*, it was one of the longest calls I've ever been on, but we never found a single trace of that kid. \nThe other was a young woman who was out hiking with her mom and grandpa. According to the mother, her daughter had climbed up a tree to get a better view of the forest, and she'd never come back down. They waited at the base of the tree for hours, calling her name, before they called for help. Again, we searched everywhere, and we never found a trace of her. I have no idea where she could possibly have gone, because neither her mother or grandpa saw her come down.\n\n* A few times, I've been out on my own searching with a canine, and they've tried to lead me straight up cliffs. Not hills, not even rock faces. Straight, sheer cliffs with no possible handholds. It's always baffling, and in those cases we usually find the person on the other side of the cliff, or miles away from where the canine has led us. I'm sure there's an explanation, but it's sort of strange.\n\n* One particularly sad case involved the recovery of a body. A nine-year-old girl fell down an embankment and got impaled on a dead tree at the base. It was a complete freak accident, but I'll never forget the sound her mother made when we told her what had happened. She saw the body bag being loaded into the ambulance, and she let out the most haunting, heart-broken wail I've ever heard. It was like her whole life was crashing down around her, and a part of her had died with her daughter. I heard from another SAR officer that she killed herself a few weeks after it happened. She couldn't live with the loss of her daughter.\n\n* I was teamed up with another SAR officer because we'd received reports of bears in the area. We were looking for a guy who hadn't come home from a climbing trip when he was supposed to, and we ended up having to do some serious climbing to get to where we figured he'd be. We found him trapped in a small crevasse with a broken leg. It was not pleasant. He'd been there for almost two days, and his leg was very obviously infected. We were able to get him into a chopper, and I heard from one of the EMTs that the guy was absolutely inconsolable. He kept talking about how he'd been doing fine, and when he'd gotten to the top, a man had been there. He said the guy had no climbing equipment, and he was wearing a parka and ski pants. He walked up to the guy, and when the guy turned around, he said he had no face. It was just blank. He freaked out, and ended up trying to get off the mountain too fast, which is why he'd fallen. He said he could hear the guy all night, climbing down the mountain and letting out these horrible muffled screams. That story bothered the hell out of me. I'm glad I wasn't there to hear it. \n\n* One of the scariest things I've ever had happen to me involved the search for a young woman who'd gotten separated from her hiking group. We were out until late at night, because the dogs had picked up her scent. When we found her, she was curled up under a large rotted log. She was missing her shoes and pack, and she was clearly in shock. She didn't have any injuries, and we were able to get her to walk with us back to base ops. Along the way, she kept looking behind us and asking us why 'that big man with black eyes' was following us. We couldn't see anyone, so we just wrote it off as some weird symptom of shock. But the closer we got to base, the more agitated this woman got. She kept asking me to tell him to stop 'making faces' at her. At one point she stopped and turned around and started yelling into the forest, saying that she wanted him to leave her alone. She wasn't going to go with him, she said, and she wouldn't give us to him. We finally got her to keep moving, but we started hearing these weird noises coming from all around us. It was almost like coughing, but more rhythmic and deeper. It was almost insect-like, I don't really know how else to describe it. When we were within site of base ops, the woman turns to me, and her eyes are about as wide as I can imagine a human could open them. She touches my shoulder and says 'He says to tell you to speed up. He doesn't like looking at the scar on your neck.' I have a very small scar on the base of my neck, but it's mostly hidden under my collar, and I have no idea how this woman saw it. Right after she says it, I hear that weird coughing right in my ear, and I just about jumped out of my skin. I hustled her to ops, trying not to show how freaked out I was, but I have to say I was really happy when we left the area that night.\n\n* This is the last one I'll tell, and it's probably the weirdest story I have. Now, I don't know if this is true in every SAR unit, but in mine, it's sort of an unspoken, regular thing we run into. You can try asking about it with other SAR officers, but even if they know what you're talking about, they probably won't say anything about it. We've been told not to talk about it by our superiors, and at this point we've all gotten so used to it that it doesn't even seem weird anymore.\nOn just about every case where we're really far into the wilderness, I'm talking 30 or 40 miles, at some point we'll find a staircase in the middle of the woods. It's almost like if you took the stairs in your house, cut them out, and put them in the forest. I asked about it the first time I saw some, and the other officer just told me not to worry about it, that it was normal. Everyone I asked said the same thing. I wanted to go check them out, but I was told, very emphatically, that I should never go near any of them. I just sort of ignore them now when I run into them because it happens so frequently. \n\nI have a lot more stories, and I suppose if anyone's interested, I'll tell some of them tomorrow. If anyone has any theories about the stairs, or if you've seen them too, let me know. \n\n**EDIT: Part 2 is up: https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/3ijnt6/im_a_search_and_rescue_officer_for_the_us_forest/**", "comments": [{"id": "cuftz65", "author": "BluRnbw", "body": "Whooooa!

Any weird stories as to why?"}, {"id": "cug24er", "author": "queen_of_the_spammed", "body": "Not SAR or \"elite\" hiker by any means. But my two stories - and I will post the \"reveals\" because they're honestly mundane.\n\nA few years back, with a large group of Scouts in Butano SP, we were hiking some godforsaken dense forest trail, in the wet california winter rains.  The first night, the racoons rolled a bunch of our bear containers down a gully into a creek. We were able to find them.  The second day, we encountered a road, and a checkpoint. The guard-booth was abandoned. There were no signs, but we concluded that it was an abandoned prison. We adults would have gone in there, but we didn't want to endanger the kids, so we hiked on.\n\nLater that night, right around 1am, I was awakened by the sound of gunfire. It was about 100 + yards away, and it was not pistols. It was some very loud, sharp, poppy guns. Different guns.  It started off slow, and then after a dozen, or so - a pause, then more, then it was steady for maybe 100+ or more, from several different guns.  Then when the other guns stopped, the loudest one kept firing, and it wasn't full-auto, but a lot of rapid fired shots.  Never got the count of the magazine between reloads, but this went on for about 20 minutes in total, then just stopped.  \n\nI got out of my sleeping bag, out of my tent, and hiked about 30 yards through the brush to the other campsite, in the dark, without my light on.  I didn't want anyone else to see me.  I got to the campsite, and the kids were all still asleep, but the other adults had heard it - had no idea what it was. Maybe pot farmers in a gunfight with intruders? Next morning, it was a topic of conversation, but most of the kids had actually slept through it.\n\nAfter we left and got home, I talked to the ranger; and they said that sometimes, people break into the prison, and use the old gun range (unauthorized).\n\nMy other story was camping in Big Sur; Silver Peak.  I was alone, but only about 5 miles from the road.\nI had just finished dinner, and lay down to sleep. After a few minutes, I heard kind of a \"crunch crunch crunch crunch\" sound, that sounded like foot steps outside. I moved my head to try to figure out what direction they were coming from, and they stopped.  I put my head back down, and a few minutes later, they started again.  \"crunch\" \"crunch\" \"crunch\" \"crunch\" - Again, I lifted my head to see what direction they were coming from, or whether it was close.  Nothing.  This cycle repeated a couple of times until I decided to turn over and open my tent flap to get a look around outside with the flashlight.  I was expecting to see a person out there, walking around in the dark, but I saw nothing. Heard nothing. Zipped up, put my head back down, tried to go back asleep.  \nAgain, \"crunch\" \"crunch\" \"crunch\" \"crunch\". Again, lifted my head, it stopped.  I tried to re-adjust, I looked outside again, I couldn't find the source.  It certainly wasn't my heart, because that was thumping like mad.  This kept me awake for hours that evening. I was terrified that there was someone or something out there; who heard my move my head, and stopped walking, only to continue, when they thought I had fallen back asleep. Maybe past midnight; but eventually I fell asleep.\n\nNext morning, I had breakfast, broke camp, and as I set up my tent, I noticed that my head was over a gopher hole."}, {"id": "cufyyib", "author": "cuntdestroyer8000", "body": "Man I have a bunch of these stories. I was in SAR as well, but all my creepy experiences have happened while camping or hiking. \n\nThis one's pretty tame...I almost always camp waaaay out, I'm talking 30-40 miles down unnamed dirt roads, up mountains, in canyons, etc. A couple years ago I was camping alone out on a prairie flat, halfway surrounded by a forest. It's nearly winter and there's not a soul within 50 miles I bet. My big hound dog was with me, as always. It was cooold, like well below freezing, so I had a roaring campfire going. Jake the dog was in & out, he'd wander off for awhile, get cold, and come back for attention and warmth. He has a bell around his collar so I can know where he is. I'm drinking beer and listening to music, so I'm not paying much attention to his whereabouts. Mind you, it's pitch black out there other than the stars. So after about 20 minutes, I hadn't seen Jake, so I call him. Nothing. I turn off my music and call louder. Nothing for about 5 minutes. I hear his bell, so I'm relieved. I heard his bell behind me, which was odd, the treeline was in front of me, where he had been sniffing around earlier. Thinking he was nearby, I relaxed and refocused on chopping some more wood. I could faintly hear his bell jingling behind me still, sometimes closer or further, and I figured he was doing the hound dog's job and smelling all around. I'd say about 40 minutes goes by, and I hadn't heard his bell or seen him. So I call him again, and get up to walk towards the treeline. Big dark forest of ponderosa pine looms in front of me. I shine my fairly bright flashlight around and into the trees. Nothing. No sound, no sight. I'm starting to get nervous, getting \"the willies\" or whatever you want to call it. I hear some crunches in the woods, like sticks and stuff breaking. Not knowing where my dog is, or much of anything other than \"ok I'm going back to the fire where my shotgun is\". I get back to my truck and my fire when I hear absolute PANIC barking from directly in front of me, from the treeline. Tearing across the field is my dog at full tilt. You could never mistake a hound dog's panic bark from a bey or a yip or whatever else, it's unlike anything. He ran behind me for a moment, and then underneath my truck. Here's the creepy part: no bell. He had his collar on, and the bell was clipped to it with a carabiner. Sure as shit I put us both in the cab of the truck for the rest of that frozen night.  To this day I still have no clue who or what was wearing that bell behind me for a few hours on a rural prairie flat in winter. "}, {"id": "cufx39b", "author": "jeepdave", "body": "How about that. I didn't realize the stairs were that common. Came across a set in rural West Virgina. I don't think I was quite 40 miles deep but atleast 10 or better. I thought maybe a house had once stood there but there was no cellar or other debris that would indicate a home was there before. Just a set of stairs with a base that went up maybe one flight. 16 or so steps if I remember right. And sturdy. Could barely Shake em. I didn't climb up though. Worried it might break/fall over and I was alone.

We get there around mid day and we set up, and relax. By now it begins to get dark so we decide to cook some food and call it a day after we eat. Now me, my cousin, and my brother, shared a tent to sleep in so I'd say around 2-3 am rolls around and I have to pee like a motherfucker. Anyways I do my stuff and head back to the tent to find the zipper wide open and my little brother gone. So I start freaking out and I wake my cousin up to tell him what happened and essentially we search until about sunrise and then we call the Rangers. They search for about 4-5 hour and they find him 10 miles away from our campsite and he has no clue how he got there all he has on is his underwear and nothing else now after this whole ordeal our cousin tells us about David Paulidas and his whole research on missing people's in national parks. Needless to say it was the most jarring and disturbing things that has ever happened in my life. It really in all honesty ruined camping for all of us and i had loved camping too.

In fact, I bet he would love to hear from you. He has written books on the subject (Missing 411 by Dave Paulides). Perhaps your stories could be investigated further and included in his next book? Most people just vanish completely.

That is what he's up to these days. He's trying to get to the bottom of it this obvious pattern and being very thorough, but he says that there is absolutely no tracking system or database for these, and finds resistance when he inquires through official channels.

The staircases.\n\nAcross the street from the farm we used to live at in Oregon, there was a huge abandoned plot of forest. It was probably 50 acres or so. It belonged to a widow who lived elsewhere, according to the older families in the area.. She and her husband had planned to build a house on it after razing the forest, but he died before the plans took root. \n\nWe used to ride our horses through the woods on dry days, and we always passed by this staircase that was leaned up on a tree a few miles in. There was never a house built there according to neighbors; the forest was too dense and old anyway. It always gave me the creeps and we jokingly called it the \"stairway to heaven\" to alleviate the tension when we rode by it. The horses weren't fans either; they got particularly spooky and snorty when we went to pass it. I'd always wondered what on earth it was doing there.

We had neighbors and all that but they were far enough away that you could just see their houses.   We had a pitbul named Buster out in the back who had a nice doghouse and plenty of room to run around and play.  There was a nice fenced in area where he couldn't just run off.  One night I awoke to this loud screaming.  I swear it sounded like a woman almost.  It was terrifying and sounded like something painful was happening to whatever was making that sound.  In panic I thought about Buster and grabbed a .357 magnum that my father gave me for my 18th birthday.  Without getting dressed I ran to the kitchen to get to the back door so I could check it out.  Fortunately my father was awake and had his shotgun and a big spotlight.  We could hear rustling way out back and more of that damned screaming.  We started running towards the noise only to spot Buster face up against the fence and screaming an angry, \"I'm gonna kill you\" type of bark that a dog only does when they feel threatened or if they've been attacked.   We could hear what sounded like limping for a bit and then it stopped.   Buster calmed down after a few minutes and we were scanning the treeline like crazy.  Finally Buster walked away and went to his bed.  We decided to let him go into the house that night.  It was a nice summer night, but we didn't want to wake up again in case anything happened.  When I got Buster to my bedroom his inside dog bed was layed out at the foot of my bed.  He went to lay down and I went back to sleep.  The next morning I woke up and looked at him and found that he had scratch markes all over his body.  Two puncture wounds on his back left thigh as well.  I rushed him to the vet and he was given antibiotics and some some other medication.  I went to where he was and found a blood trail.  Turns out he got into a scuffle with a big wildcat.

I found the staircase while walking through foliage so thick I didn't see it until it was almost underfoot. The stairs were made of loose cobble and moist earth like they were a work of masonry once, long ago. They were dusted with shards of worn glass and shreds of burnt parchment, at the base I found a rusted tin medallion no larger than a coin resting on the moss. Now I couldn't have been too far from civilization but in that moment I felt like I was the only human on earth, standing there wrapped in walls of leaves and branches. I climbed the stairs thoughtlessly, effortlessly, half expecting there to be a landing to greet me at the top. There wasn't though. Just another crumbly step and an unimpressive view. I could see the red tin roof of the DPW yard I cut through to get here, and beyond it glistening smoke-stacks reached up towards the clouds, spilling white smoke into the clear blue sky. Each stack topped by a hazy red light blinking lazily, beckoning me back to reality. To my right the tall, thick brambles bled into cat tails that stretchedall the way to a distant tree line. Something caught my eye as I craned my head, the bushes were packed tight except where the stumps of long dead trees formed sunken wells around them, and from one of the craters someone was looking at me, their gaze fixed. I remember clearly their dark, lean face, their round eyes black like the eyes of a doll flashing in the sun. No sooner had I seen the face than it disappeared again, only then did I have the foresight to take off down the steps and back through the bushes and brambles towards the buildings I could no longer see. It's a different world in the bushes, a claustrophobic world of sharp sticks and thin corridors, a blur of green and black that blots out the sun. Thankfully I was younger then, my feet carried me over the marshy ground and delivered me to freedom, delivered me to the chainlink fence that drew the line between realities and the hole I'd cut that blurred it.

And read more nosleep stories of course, but still. \nAnyway, I used to work at a lot of conventions when I was about 20. I lived in the Delaware valley. My manager lived in upstate PA and there were a lot of car, truck & hunting shows that way that his agency would book shows for us. Anyway, my parents were out of town and I was watching their dog, Blue. He was an 80 lb English shepherd and an alpha. He didn't respect me much but he would have died protecting me bc he knew I was pack. Anyway, there was a show that weekend and I usually stayed at my manager's house in his guest house for the weekend shows. I had to take my dog w me since I was watching him. \n\nI got there the Friday before the convention and took my dog for a walk down the road. It was dusk and gorgeous and way more wooded and secluded than my hometown so I was enjoying it. We walked a fair way down the road and then I decided to take him off the path and into a little clearing I could vaguely see through the trees. So we get into this clearing and there is lots of tall grass and it is dusk so visibility is low. He is sniffing around and generally enjoying himself and then at the same time we both notice the grass at the opposite side of the clearing moving (probably 200-300 ft away). He immediately stiffens and lets out this visceral growl that I have never heard him make before. Not just the \"someone is at the door\" growl, but a \"our lives are in immediate danger and I will attack and kill if need be\" growl. So I start getting nervous and back up a bit. I'm thinking from the size of the movement (the grass was a little over waist high) that it's maybe a cougar or wolf or whatever my imagination is scaring me with. In retrospect I WISH it was a cougar or wolf. Anyway, I am trying to get Blue out of the clearing and back to the road but he is frozen stiff and not budging. He is in full flight or fight mode and he's obviously chosen the latter. The thing is moving around, kind of foraging and what seems to be looking for food. While it's moving back and forth I catch a glimpse of it really fast through a sparse area of grass and it looks seriously like one of the werewolves from tv. It was mostly naked with a ridge of fur down its back and it's face kind of looked like a hyena. In all honesty it could have been a huge dog or wolf with mange. But it's legs were all wrong. Most canine-like animals walk on their toes with the first bend in their legs being their ankle. The second bend is their knee, and their hips aren't visible the way ours are. So their legs look like this:\n<\n _>\n(Poor rendering, I know). \nAnyway, this thing's legs were backwards. It's feet pointed backwards and the first bend in it's leg pointed forwards. The second (that should have been it's knee) pointed backwards. Like this:\n   >\n<_\nSo, I dragged my dog by the scruff of his neck and jogged home at a brisk pace. \nIt never noticed we were there. My only logical explanation was that maybe it was a large dog or wolf with mange and a severe genetic defect. But I have done a lot of work in dog rescue and I've never seen a defect like that. That being said, it might exist, but any kind of defect I've ever seen of that magnitude has rendered the dog immobile. This thing was walking and trotting like nobody's business. \nStill don't know WTF that thing was and would prefer there to be a logical explanation but I haven't really found one. "}, {"id": "cug3wp6", "author": "LifeFailure", "body": "Speaking of strange wilderness occurences, my first camping trip was when I was about 8 or 9 years old. One of my mom's friends invited us to stay at her family's sort of mini-cabins (they were like one-room cabins that each had two twin beds in them and an end table in between). \n\nI don't remember much of the trip very vividly, but I do distinctly remember walking with my dad and brother through the woods to meet up with my mom and the other campers. I kept getting scared/panicky and wanting to go faster because every tree and log I looked at seemed to have reptilian eyes peering out of knotholes. One in particular looked exactly like an alligator with grey-brown skin (think ash tree), and I swear I even saw it blink. When I freaked out and told my dad and brother, they said I was being silly and it was just a dead/hollow log. I looked back and it was indeed just an empty log with a hole in the side.\n\nThis might have just been me terrified of alligators and snakes and things, or having been too affected by that one scene in Snow White where she runs through the woods and sees eyes everywhere (or a combination of the two), but I swear I wasn't just imagining the eyes. The log was more of a \"first glance\" sort of mistake, especially because I was already on edge, but I kept seeing the eyes in literally every knothole before they disappeared when I looked back. While I have a damn vivid imagination, I *never* hallucinate things, and by that I mean I never actually see things that aren't there. Even my imaginary friends were always strictly invisible, so if I ever saw something I was very sure it was real.

There has to be something coming from above. \n\nIn so many cases, there are no footprints or tracks of any kind. Dogs lose the scent. People just disappear, in a blink of an eye.\n\nPeople, especially kids, are found ridiculous distances away from where they go missing, sometimes these are toddlers who could not possibly cover that amount of ground even if it were flat. Climbing a tree and never coming down. \n\nAnd people are found at higher ground, sometimes up or over sheer cliffs they could not possibly scale. They are found in the middle of ponds with no footprints on the edge. Some appear to have fallen from a great height. They are found in places that multiple search teams covered.\n\nFor small children, it would seem plausible they were carried away by eagles or other large birds of prey. I don't think there are many stories like that coming from survivors, though. If they remember anything and are able to communicate, they talk of being lured somehow. The stories seem idiosyncratic; some see relatives or strange people, some see odd animals. \n\nThe stairs are definitely creepy, and I'd never heard of them before.
