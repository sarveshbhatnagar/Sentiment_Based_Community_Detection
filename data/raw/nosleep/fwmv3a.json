Well, we were supposed to be. Something went wrong when he was born, and for as long as I\u2019ve known him, he\u2019s never been able to move. At all. He sits in a wheelchair all day, staring into space like he\u2019s just zoning out for a second. But he\u2019s not. The doctors say he hears and understands everything. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nHe\u2019s my mom\u2019s entire life. As soon as I was old enough to use the microwave by myself, I was completely ignored. I learned how to cook, how to ride a bike, how to take a bus, all by myself. She\u2019s just too busy with him. \u201cYou understand, don\u2019t you, Jonathan?\u201d she always says. \u201cI need to clean him.\u201d \u201cI need to take him to one of his appointments.\u201d \u201cI need to run his feeding tube.\u201d \u201cI need to go to work so we can afford better equipment for him.\u201d There\u2019s always an excuse. So I go and play with my friends from school, and their moms are nice to me. They have dads, too, who didn\u2019t disappear after they were born. Sometimes their dads will throw a ball around with us. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI never really understood why my mom worked so hard for my brother. He never responded to anything, except maybe blinking \u201cyes\u201d and \u201cno\u201d. I can\u2019t tell you how many times I\u2019ve tried to talk to him, tell him about my day, give him a chance to answer. He doesn\u2019t. It\u2019s really boring. So I stopped talking to him as much. I didn\u2019t really hate him, then, I was just bitter and lonely and liked to pretend my friends were my brothers instead.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThings changed five years ago, when I was eight. Mom and Andy came home from one of the doctor\u2019s appointments. Mom had a weird look on her face, and she sat me down and talked to me, just one on one, for the first time in a while. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nAt first she was just asking normal things, like how I was, what my friends\u2019 names were, how I liked school. In minutes, I was jabbering away, telling her my entire life story because I never got this time alone with her. I was so excited. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThen she dropped the bomb.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\u201cJonathan, one of Andy\u2019s doctors has a very interesting machine he\u2019d like to try on Andy. But we need your help. Would you help me and your brother?\u201d \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI was in such a good mood. Of course I said yes. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nWe went to a clinic, and the lady at the front desk directed us straight to the basement. I\u2019d never been in a doctor\u2019s basement before. It looked straight out of a sci-fi movie. Big whirring devices, cables, flashing lights, screens with x-rays and other brain pictures I couldn\u2019t identify. It was almost a little bit scary. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nBut the doctor was nice. He sat me in a chair and put a bunch of stickers all over my head. He told me that it wouldn\u2019t hurt one bit.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHe was right. In fact, not only did it not hurt, I didn\u2019t think anything had happened at all. The only clue was the fact that everyone was wearing different clothes, and that my mom was crying. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n\u201cDid it help Andy?\u201d I asked her. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nShe kissed me on the head. \u201cYes, it did. So much.\u201d \n\n&#x200B;\n\nSatisfied, I smiled at my brother. Obviously he didn\u2019t smile back, but I got the strangest feeling of dread when he stared at me. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nWe went back multiple times. Each time, it seemed, full days had passed without me realizing it. My friends would tell me that I\u2019d been acting differently. My mom suddenly knew all these things about Andy she couldn\u2019t possibly know, like what his favorite color was (she started only buying him green shirts) and what he wanted to be when he grew up (she would show him videos about painting. I don\u2019t know why. How was he going to paint?) \n\n&#x200B;\n\nEven as a little kid, I started to figure out what was going on. Andy was sharing my body. And while he was in control, it was like I was asleep. I\u2019d just wake up without knowing anything about what he\u2019d done as me. I became the only person who had never met my brother, even though he shared a house with me, and spent most of his time gazing at me with greed in his eyes. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe memory gaps grew longer and longer. My mom doted on Andy more and more. I started marking days in a secret calendar I didn\u2019t tell anyone about, not even when mom did her sneaky interrogations to try and find out things Andy should know about my life. The first time she let him keep my body for a week, I stopped talking to her entirely. Then she let him keep my body for a month, and I blew up. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t do this! My friends barely talk to me anymore! I don\u2019t even know what\u2019s going on in school half the time! You guys keep going places without me, and I just keep getting worse at soccer because he doesn\u2019t practice! I don\u2019t like it and I don\u2019t want to share anymore!\u201d\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy mother gave me a long, thoughtful look. \u201cOkay, Jonathan. Let\u2019s do this one more time. Andy really wanted to try swimming. Just once. You can let him try it once, can\u2019t you, Jonathan?\u201d \n\n&#x200B;\n\n\u201cFor the last time, I go by Johnny,\u201d I grumbled. \u201cWill you promise to call me that?\u201d\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\u201cOf course, sweetheart. Whatever you want.\u201d \n\n&#x200B;\n\n\u201cThen fine. Just one more time. And only for a day!\u201d\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe next time I woke up, I was back in my room. My brother was in his wheelchair, as usual, but he looked very, very different. And when I looked in the mirror, so did I. I was taller. There were small, fine hairs on my upper lip. I had pimples. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI ran to my calendar, made a note of the last date I had marked, and then checked the family calendar. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThree years. Three years had passed. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI refused to believe this. Even though it was now fall outside, and when I had \u201cgone to sleep\u201d it had been the beginning of summer. Even though my bedsheets and blankets had changed to something less childish. Even though my room was covered in stupid paintings that barely looked like anything. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhen it did finally hit me, I cried. I cried for a long, long time. I had lost so much of my life. I was a ten year old in a thirteen year old\u2019s body. My mom had allowed this - wanted it, even. Had anyone noticed that I was gone? \n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy sobbing calmed into sniffles when I realized Andy had not blinked in over an hour. Actually, his eyes were kind of glassy and even more unfocused than usual. When I poked at him, he was kind of cold and he didn\u2019t react by looking at me. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n\u201cAndy! I\u2019m home!\u201d I heard my mother yell from downstairs as the front door shut behind her. \u201cCome downstairs, I\u2019ll make you a snack!\u201d \n\n&#x200B;\n\nA feeling I\u2019d never really experienced bubbled up inside my chest. It was white-hot and ice cold at the same time, and it made my mother\u2019s voice sound like the devil talking. My face turned as expressionless as Andy\u2019s, but I did as she asked. I went downstairs. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n\u201cHello, sweetheart,\u201d my mother greeted, kissing my forehead. \u201cHow was your day?\u201d\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy day? I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t even know what my year was like, thanks to her. \u201cFine,\u201d I managed to grunt. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n\u201cGood. I have to tell you some worrying news, dear. The cardiologist called, and he said the tests showed that your other body might have something wrong with its heart. We\u2019re going to take your old body in to see him again, maybe tomorrow. I know it\u2019s tedious, darling, but we wouldn\u2019t want anything happening to it.\u201d \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI stayed silent, which she took as me being mad. \u201cDon\u2019t sulk, dear. It\u2019s necessary to keep you alive. You know that.\u201d\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\u201cYeah,\u201d I answered. I knew that when she went upstairs, she would find the old body as I had found it. \u201cI want a snack.\u201d\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\u201cAlright. Go get a plate from the cupboard.\u201d \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI did get the plate, but what also caught my eye was a large, shiny knife with a jagged edge. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n\u201cHey, mom?\u201d I called casually while she busied herself at the stove. Whatever she was cooking didn\u2019t smell appetizing. Or maybe it did to Andy. \u201cDo you think we should ever give Johnny the chance to wake up again? See what he\u2019s missed?\u201d\n\n&#x200B;\n\nShe tsk\u2019ed. \u201cOh no, darling. It\u2019s been far too long. He would just be confused. It\u2019s much better this way. Still, that\u2019s such a kind thought for your - \u201c She paused in the middle of stirring. \u201cDid you call him Johnny?\u201d\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe next sound out of her mouth was a scream as I plunged the knife into her back. Then I pulled it out and did it again. \u201cAndy\u2019s dead,\u201d I told her, enjoying everything minute of it. \u201cAnd Johnny is never going away, ever again.\u201d \n\n&#x200B;\n\nFor now I live with two corpses in my house. They\u2019re starting to smell, so I might bury them in the back garden. But other than that, I\u2019m okay. I know how to take care of myself.", "comments": [{"id": "fmp9ozf", "author": "woodchipper2point0", "body": "Hey man, I'd kill her too"}, {"id": "fmp6w7i", "author": "666wife", "body": "Why would she do that?
