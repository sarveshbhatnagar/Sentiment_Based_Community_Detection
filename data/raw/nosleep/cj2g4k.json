The lack of sleep is making me wonder whether all these things happening are in my mind or not. But I\u2019m reminded every time I see that damn note that it\u2019s all real. \n\nI spent hours last night searching for anything I could about Prudence Hemmings. If she had lived in a big creepy mansion I imagine she would have been easy to find. But us folk who live in tower blocks aren\u2019t so well documented. No one cares about our lives, no matter how extraordinary.\n\nI found an article about missing person Lyla Hemmings. It suggested that she went missing under the care of her grandmother while playing in the park opposite the flats early in the morning. Interviews with her parents stated that they had both disowned Prudence. \n\nDespite the many years that had passed since Lyla\u2019s death/disappearance her parents appeared to have remained unforgiving of Prue. There was no mention of her on either of their social media accounts and she appeared to have no involvement with the children they had acquired since. \n\nSearches for the Hemmings family in the local area were equally dead ends, I looked at link after link, desperate to find something but they all started to blur into one. Until finally I saw something. \n\nAn obituary for Bernard \u201cBernie\u201d Hemmings, who had fallen from the tower block in unexplained circumstances after being diagnosed with dementia months before his death. I was surprised it hadn\u2019t made bigger news. It had only been about a year. There were no details of where to find them, but his wife Prudence and her sister Bridget were listed as contacts to get find out details of the funeral. \n\nIt\u2019s scary what you can do with the internet these days, but just with those phone numbers I was able to put them into a reverse directory and find an address for Bridget and Tony Bishop, the sister and brother in law that Prudence was supposedly living with.\n\nAbout 4am I managed to get some sleep, not much though, I was back up and wide awake at around 7am, planning my route and working out my day. I saw a post on social media from one of her relatives that Georgia was identified and is stable. This loosened the knot in my stomach that has been present since I found the note somewhat. \n\nAt 8.50, I opened the door to my flat hoping to see postman Ian. 4 minutes passed and instead of the postman an elderly gentleman made his way down the corridor. He had a walking stick and kind eyes. In his free arm he carried a small plastic bag containing a newspaper and milk, he smiled and said \u201cgood morning\u201d as he passed.\n\nI smiled back. He reminded me of my grandad. I imagined him pulling cola cubes from his pocket for his grandkids and shushing them when their parents weren\u2019t looking. A little further down the corridor the old man stopped and turned. He looked me dead in the eyes with a sympathetic expression and spoke.\n\n\u201cNo post on a Sunday, if that\u2019s what you were waiting for.\u201d He smiled knowingly and turned to unlock a front door that until shut I couldn\u2019t see the number of. When I saw the door close and the number 48 boldly displayed above the peephole I understood what Prudence had meant. Mr Prentice did seem to be a lovely chap. \n\nI sat back in my flat and sighed, staring at the various tabs open on my laptop. At about 9.15 the knocking on the balcony door started.\n\nThe window cleaner was back.\n\nI didn\u2019t feel half as terrified as I had the first time, if anything, I was just angry. It took every ounce of restraint I had in my tired body not to engage with him, if only to tell him to fuck off. His genuine seeming requests just irritated me. After about 20 minutes of being watched the knocking started to give me a headache, so I grabbed a bag and left the flat.\n\nI decided there was no time like the present. If I was going to turn up on the Bishops\u2019 doorstep looking for her sister because of the freaky flat she\u2019s left behind then I had to get it over with. If the address was old, or the bishops weren\u2019t the people I was looking for then I was going to look stupid whatever time of day I went.\n\nAnd I couldn\u2019t take the window cleaners eyes anymore. There was something about them, they really do make you want to open that door. \n\nI looked at the lift as I entered the communal hallway and decided today I would take the stairs. I couldn\u2019t stand to be in a small box that my partner probably died very painfully in. My heart dropped into my stomach just at the sight of it.\n\nThe stairs were as grotty as the lift. We\u2019d taken them multiple times on move in day but I hadn\u2019t really taken it in the same way I could now. I thought about the rules and all the strange things happening in this building. I looked at the badly painted numbers on the walls as I reached each landing.\n\nNothing in this building is simple.\n\nI looked at the numbers. 7, 6, 5 ... 5, 4, 3, 4, 2, G. Maybe it was the sleep deprivation but my legs were in agreement with my mind that I had definitely just descended more than 6 flights of stairs. They\u2019d glitched. \n\nI looked at the dusty and poorly lit stairwell from the bottom. It seemed dark despite the sun pouring in from the glass panel in the main building doors. The note never mentioned glitchy stairs, maybe I really was losing my mind. \n\nAs I turned to exit the building a woman walked in. She was in her late thirties to early forties and had 2 small children in tow. One boy and one girl. I guessed that they were twins, they were both incredibly blonde, with deep brown puppy dog looking eyes and couldn\u2019t have been any older than 6-7. They were as close to identical as it gets in twins of different genders. I\u2019m not a fan of kids, but they were super cute. \n\nThe lady had a short bob haircut that got longer at the front, it was uniform and dyed a perfectly even auburn colour. I knew it was dyed because her roots were blonde like her kids. She looked as tired as I felt, but she pulled herself together when she saw me, running fingers through s part of her hair that she must have missed how ever early she left this morning. \n\n\u201cHi, are you here visiting?\u201d Who opened with, trying to make small talk. \n\n\u201cNo, I just moved in to flat 42, on the 7th floor, I was just leaving actually. Whereabouts are you?\u201d I was desperate to go, I had feared myself up to see Prue but I didn\u2019t want to be rude.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m flat 26, my name\u2019s Terri. This is Eddie and Ellie.\u201d She gestured to the two small children hiding shyly behind her skirt. \u201cWelcome to the block. If you ever need anything please feel free to give me a shout.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy name is Katie but people call me Kat too. That\u2019s really kind of you, thank you. I will.... hey, is there something wrong with the stairs?\u201d I stopped myself before going into detail.\n\n\u201cNothing wrong, they just skip sometimes.\u201d She answered, shrugging. \n\n\u201cWell I\u2019d love to stop and chat but I actually really need to get going. It was nice to meet you Terri.\u201d I tried to work out what was wrong with the children as I stepped forward to walk away. Still baffled by the stairs.\n\n\u201cBy the way, we have a residents committee, you should come to one of our meetings, they\u2019re every Tuesday in alternating flats. This Tuesday is at Molly Jefferson\u2019s place in flat 31, come along. We\u2019d love to have you!\u201d Terri suggested, waving me off. \n\nI walked out the doors after my encounter with Terri feeling sick. Every minute in this place made the note more real. Every word jumped off the page and into my life. Made it more likely that Jamie was really gone. \n\nI rode the bus from a stop not far from the flats. It felt like it took and eternity to reach the little suburban area I was looking for. A five minute walk away from the bus stop I got off at and I was staring at a quaint little bungalow, belonging to Bridget and Tony Bishop. \n\nI knocked on the door. The lady who opened it was unsteady on her feet, she was probably in her 70s, with wispy white hair neatly scraped back into a bun, two strands left hanging that just softened her wrinkled face. She wore a dusty rose coloured dress that hung just below her knees and smelled of stale cigarette smoke. \n\n\u201cCan I help you?\u201d She asked bluntly.\n\n\u201cMy name is Kat. I\u2019m looking for Prudence Hemmings.\u201d I answered, stuttering slightly. \n\nHer eyes widened slightly.\n\n\u201cWhy?\u201d She asked, bizarrely. \n\n\u201cIs she here? It\u2019s private.\u201d \n\nThe lady ushered me into the house, and sat me down on a sofa, within minutes there was a cup of tea in front of me. She didn\u2019t say anything to me for a while, we just looked at each other. Then she finally broke the silence. \n\n\u201cI wondered if you\u2019d try and find me. It took me a long time to decide whether to leave that note or not but I decided that you deserved a head start. That\u2019s more than I ever got.\u201d\n\nThe woman was Prudence, she was nothing like I had imagined. She seemed tough and hardened and spoke with a mostly blunt tone, she contributed before I could answer.\n\n\u201cTerri called me not long ago. Told me that she had met the new tenant. She said you looked shaken up, and said that my note may not have been enough. I did say I couldn\u2019t fit everything on there. And the stairs didn\u2019t seem too important. The committee wanted to organise a meeting with you on your moving in day but I told them that was intrusive. The whole committee thing always seemed a bit excessive to me anyway.\u201d She spoke flippantly, like it was nothing. \n\n\u201cIt may have been intrusive, but we needed a warning, we spent a night in the place before I found your note! My boyfriend had already left for work at 3.15 and taken the lift.... he didn\u2019t know.\u201d I broke as I told her what had happened. Her face dropped. And so did my hope for Jamie. \n\n\u201cI\u2019m so sorry... I really don\u2019t know what to say. I thought my note would reach you in time.\u201d She mumbled, her face to the floor, refusing to look at me as tears streamed down my face.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s gone isn\u2019t he. I didn\u2019t want to accept it but I spoke to the postman and your face says all it needs to. The postman said there might be a way I can have him back.\u201d I bit at her, devastated and angry.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s gone. You can\u2019t have him back. What Ian is referring to isn\u2019t what you think. There\u2019s a way to get people back from the lift. But not as themselves. Trust me, I learned the hard way. Once they\u2019re back you can\u2019t reverse it. I\u2019m sorry about your man. But he\u2019s gone forever. Don\u2019t dig into the other way, to be gone forever is luckier than that alternative.\u201d She still wouldn\u2019t look up from the floor.\n\n\u201cWhat do you mean...\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to talk about it. I said in the note that there are things I\u2019d rather not discuss and I need you to respect that or I won\u2019t be speaking to you at all. Now move on and ask what you need to ask.\u201d Prudence cut me off, I decided not to push the topic further, and moved on to some other things I needed to know.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the deal with Terri\u2019s kids? They seem sweet and normal.\u201d\n\n\u201cThose little demon creatures are anything but normal.\u201d She answered, wincing slightly at the though of them. \u201cWhen she went into labour Terri never made it to a hospital. They were the first children ever to be born inside the building and with everything that goes on it\u2019s like something\u2019s rubbed off on them. They\u2019re average children in the daytime, but they never sleep, ever. Poor Terri hasn\u2019t had a days rest since they were born. They also really love to steal birds and rats they find the cats playing with and torment them. Really annoys the cats.\u201d \n\nAs she finished speaking a small hairless cat strutted out from behind an armchair across the room, meowing softly. It brushed its head up against Prue\u2019s exposed legs, leaving scorch marks where it touched. She didn\u2019t react, she reached down and stroked the top of its head, smiling as it purred. \n\n\u201cAnd those?\u201d I asked, eyes stuck to her now badly burned legs. \n\nShe chuckled, pulled out a box and lit a cigarette, tapping the top layer of ash into a small silver dish in front of her. She offered me one and I took it gladly. \n\n\u201cThey\u2019ve always been my good friends. I couldn\u2019t leave the building without bringing a part of home with me. This little guy is Damon. He\u2019s seen some things.\u201d She gushed, not taking her eyes off the cat. \n\n\u201cBut where did they come from, why are they everywhere?\u201d I asked, watching in disbelief as her burns subsided. It seemed impossible, but I looked at my arms where I had picked up the cat the night before and there was no evidence it had ever happened. They didn\u2019t even appear sunburnt. \n\n\u201cNo one really knows. They started to appear after the fire, a few years after I\u2019d moved in. It was rumoured that they were the pets of the residents that burned, and that was why they had no fur. But I don\u2019t think that\u2019s true.\u201d\n\nI interrupted.\n\n\u201cI met one of those neighbours last night. She said her name was Natalia. She almost killed my best friend. You\u2019re crazy if you think your note was enough of a warning!\u201d I ranted emotionally.\n\n\u201cLook, girl. If I had made a song and dance about warning you, then you\u2019d have thought me crazy and challenged the rules. You\u2019d have been dead already. Be grateful you got anything. I didn\u2019t. I had to work it all out. Your generation are so spoiled.\u201d She tutted in frustration at me. I was angry, but she was probably right. An elderly lady telling me rat like creatures would kill my boyfriend in a lift would probably have got some laughs from me a few days ago. I stayed quiet and waited for her to calm down, after a while she sighed and started again.\n\n\u201cI think the cats are the neighbours that burned. They\u2019ve never meant any harm and they hiss and run from the imposters that roam the building. Besides, there\u2019s no way there were that many cats living on one floor. \n\nThe imposter people don\u2019t even match up with the residents that died in the fire, none of them look like, or claim to have the same name as the dead. They just claim to live in their flats. I\u2019ve met Natalia before, she left a bad scar on Bernie\u2019s leg from an incident we had, nasty girl. \n\nBefore the fire there was cctv and there was a recording saved of about 15 people marching into the flats and up to that floor about half an hour before the fire started. It was the only evidence found. CCTV wasn\u2019t great in the eighties so they were never identified. And the flames melted the relevant cameras so nothing ever came of it. \n\nI think the people that entered that night are the ones that ask for sugar. I don\u2019t know any more than that but if you avoid them like I said you don\u2019t need to know more. They hate the cats. I hope your friend survives, but I\u2019ve seen what those people can do so maybe she was better off dead.\u201d Prue carried on stroking Damon. I watched the skin of her fingers melt and twist as they made contact with him.\n\n\u201cWhat happened to your husband?\u201d \n\nI asked the question so fast I didn\u2019t have time to consider that this was a topic she had explicitly said she didn\u2019t want to discuss in the note. But I had to know. \n\nShe scowled at me. \u201cI said I didn\u2019t want to talk about that.\u201d She hissed.\n\n\u201cI just lost the love of my life. I need some answers.\u201d I begged.\n\n\u201cWhat happened to Bernie won\u2019t help you. I know you\u2019d think any deaths in that building would be down to the quirks but this wasn\u2019t. For the most part anyway.\n\nDon\u2019t forget that we had lived there for 35 years, Bernie knew the rules, we knew how to take care of ourselves and have a happy life there. It was our home.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t doubt that\u2019s Mrs Hemmings, I\u2019m sorry\u201d I interjected.\n\n\u201cBernie had dementia. It started about 6 months before he died and he deteriorated very rapidly. Towards the end he started wandering, the doctors said it was common, but in our position it was incredibly dangerous. More times than I can count I pulled him away from the lift just in time.\n\nAlong with wandering he was forgetting the rules. He let that smug awful window cleaner in 3 times, thank lord for the big metal pipe I kept by the balcony door, chased him out a treat. Not that anything stops him from coming back. I\u2019m sure you\u2019re already acquainted. \n\nAfter all the dangerous situations Bernie was in, by the end he made the smallest and most fatal of errors. \n\nHe left a bowl of food out for Damon at 10am. I was out shopping with Terri and a few of the girls from the committee and when I came back I found one of those awful creatures...\u201d \n\nPrudence started to cry. I put my hand on her shoulder in an attempt to comfort her, after all, I truly knew how she felt. \n\n\u201cIt was eating him.\u201d She sniffed and steadied herself to continue, moving my hand. \u201cI chased the creature away with the same metal pipe I had the window cleaner and pushed Bernie off the balcony. He was heavy but I didn\u2019t want anyone to know what really killed him. It\u2019s teeth..\u201d she shivered \u201c...they made such an awful noise. It reminded me of -\u201c\n\n\u201cLyla.\u201d I finished her sentence. I hadn\u2019t meant to. I was so invested in her story I couldn\u2019t help it. \n\n\u201cI gather you spoke with Ian then.\u201d She said sounding resigned. \u201cI never meant to hurt that little girl. I loved her so much.\u201d Tears rolled down her wrinkled cheeks. Damon, who was now sat next to her on the sofa, shuffled closer as if to cuddle her. \n\n\u201cHaven\u2019t you ever been curious about getting her back?\u201d I asked, my mind turning back to the methods hinted at by both Prue and the postman. \u201cI miss Jamie so much. I\u2019d do anything to get him back.\u201d\n\nHer face filled with a look of horror and shame. \u201cOf course I have.\u201d She answered, \u201cwhich is exactly why I\u2019m telling you not to.\u201d \n\nBut I couldn\u2019t let it go. \n\n\u201cSurely anything must be better than gone forever?\u201d I pestered. I wish I hadn\u2019t.\n\nPrudence, frustrated, stood up and gestured for me to follow, she lead me outside to the back garden of the bungalow. At the back was a large shed, the kind people used for a man cave or a summer house. It was pretty, the sun shone down on it lighting up the few cobwebs in the corners and making them twinkle. \n\nMrs Hemmings was careful to look into both neighbouring gardens to ensure there was no one around before she unlocked the door to the shed. We stepped inside and the first thing to hit me was the smell, it was putrid, like rotting meat. I looked at the floor and covered my nose with my hands, staring back at me was a pool of blood.\n\nI followed the blood with my eyes as Prudence locked us in the shed. Then after I made it past the animal bones I finally saw it.\n\nJust like postman Ian had described.\n\nOne of the creatures was watching me, from a heavy duty metal dog cage in the corner of the shed. It looked reinforced but still the metal had chew marks. Their jaws had to be strong to cause that.\n\nThat didn\u2019t surprise me looking at it, it\u2019s rodent like nose and beady, yet somehow human like  eyes were nothing compared to the two very visible rows of jagged sharp teeth that lined each gum. Despite its small stature, it was terrifying. \n\nPrudence opened a drawer in a dusty cupboard across the room and pulled out a can of dog food, she poured the contents into the bowl  and passed the bowl through the feeding hatch. The cage had a safety feature meaning the animal couldn\u2019t access the food until the hatch was locked from the outside. I was grateful for this.\n\nPrue turned to me and spoke. She brushed one of the two strands of hair framing her face behind her ear. Gesturing to the hideous creature she said;\n\n\u201cKat, I would like to introduce you to my granddaughter, Lyla.\u201d\n\nHow the conversation went on : https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/cjintp/the_previous_tenant_of_my_new_flat_left_a/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app", "comments": [{"id": "evaomru", "author": "NoSleepAutoBot", "body": "It looks like there may be more to this story.

You really really need to get some firearms ASAP. Preferably in the next day or so. Again, a 12 gauge is ideal for anything 1-30 yards with buckshot shells. Also, don\u2019t underestimate a .45 pistol. Cover a doorway (hopefully still locked) from a safe spot. \n\n3. Make sure you don\u2019t try to explore and stretch the rules too much. You\u2019re still new and you will definitely miss a rule and make a possibly deadly error. Prudence managed to live for over three decades, practice makes perfect. \n\n4. Allow yourself to mourn Jamie. That simple. Let yourself accept it, as horrible and tragic as it is. I feel for you immensely, that\u2019s why I want to see the best for you. \n\nStay as safe as possible!\nGod bless"}, {"id": "evb4hqg", "author": "OhCai", "body": "No post on Sunday!"}, {"id": "evaxtcp", "author": "Ravenwight", "body": "Honestly, this place still sounds better than some of the places I\u2019ve rented."}, {"id": "evb1935", "author": "crlcan81", "body": "Holy fuck, those creatures are actually...?!?!

Along with other deities such as Hathor, Sekhmet, and Isis, Bastet was associated with the Eye of Ra.\n\nBastet was also a goddess of pregnancy and childbirth (The twins like to play with the cats \u201cofferings\u201d)\n\nImages of Bastet were often created from alabaster (pale, hairless?) \n\nBastet was also depicted as the goddess of protection against contagious diseases and evil spirits (hence why the appeared after the \u201cresidents\u201d of the burned flats arrived?)\n\nWhy an ancient Egyptian goddess would show up in London however....? \n\nAlthough.... the things that ate Lyla, that she had now become... they do sound like Jackals, which in Egyptian mythology were do with Anubis, the god of Death... which in turn leads to his daughter, the serpent goddess Kebechet... who is the enemy of Ra and Bastet... \n\nWow, bit of a stream of consciousness there!"}, {"id": "evb4540", "author": "eduty", "body": "Wow.

Wasn't there a rule in the movie about not feeding them, ever, otherwise they turned into these terrible creatures? (correct me if I'm wrong please \ud83d\ude42)\n\nI'd be curious if Op could actually talk to one of them when they're not feeding, of course. The residents were able to negotiate a stalemate with them; so, they must also posess a certain degree of intelligence. How did they get there? Who is the boss/leader? Is there a way that they'd release Jamie, unharmed, as a show of good faith to the new tenants?(I know that's a reach \ud83d\ude42)\n\nI believe Natalia is a demon. Prue said that the CCTV footage had shown 15 people approaching the floor that went up in flames. In life, the residents of the floor were evil. In death, because of the, as of yet, unknown power of the building, they became the supernatural equivalent of what they had been in life.\n\nThe \"skip\" with the stairs: Possibly where the creatures reside when they aren't feeding. \nBut, it seems like there should be some place that might be considered a central focal point/ a power point, as it were. It could be located in what seems to be \"dead space\" between floors.\n\nOh and when did the window cleaner get killed? Was he one of the fire floor residents?\n\nWhy is Ian stuck in the same apparent time warp?\n\nI hope Op decides to take up residence elsewhere. \n\nKii\n\nEdit: typo"}, {"id": "evbn9kd", "author": "jonnyocean", "body": "This is absolutely riveting stuff.
