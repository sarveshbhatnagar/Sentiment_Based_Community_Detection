What did they want you to be?\u201d\n\n\u201cA dentist.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s funny,\u201d I said. I could feel myself beginning to smile.\n\n\u201cWhat do your parents want you to be?\u201d it asked.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know.... Hey Frank?\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah?\u201d\n\n\u201cAren\u2019t you gonna... like... scare me or something?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat? Why would I do that?\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, you\u2019re a monster, aren\u2019t you?\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, yeah, of course I am, but that doesn\u2019t mean that I scare little kids.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut I thought that was your job.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is my job to scare people,\u201d he replied. \u201cBut only bad people.\u201d\n\n\u201cAm I a bad person?\u201d I asked.\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d he said, \u201cbut you\u2019re not the one I\u2019m here to scare.\u201d\n\n\u201cWho are you here to scare?\u201d I asked.\n\n\u201cThe man inside your closet.\u201d \n\nThe skin on my arms goosefleshed up. I wanted to ask him what he meant, but I fell silent as I heard a rustling coming from the closet. The door creaked open, and I could hear soft footsteps padding towards me across the bedroom floor. I didn\u2019t dare peek out of the blanket. The footsteps stopped, and I could hear heavy breathing next to me. I squeezed my eyes tight.\n\nThe warm sanctuary of the blanket disappeared as it was yanked off me.\n\nI hugged my arms around my knees and prepared for the worst. A scream shattered the night air, followed by the sound of breaking glass. I opened my eyes a crack to see a knife lying on the carpet next to my bed, blade glinting in the moonlight.\n\nMy parents rushed into the room and asked me what had happened, but I didn\u2019t know what to say, only that someone had been hiding in my closet and they\u2019d jumped out the window. \n\nMy parents called 911, and the police came right away. They picked up a man called Gary Thompson sprinting through the streets a couple blocks away. He was covered in blood and broken glass. They found Gary\u2019s car abandoned on our property, and inside they found duct tape, knives, barbiturates and a video camera. \n\nFrom what I heard Gary\u2019s lawyer employed an insanity defense, and Gary is currently incarcerated in a state mental facility for the criminally insane. \n\nI never heard from Frank the monster again, but the officer who arrested Gary told me that he sleeps on the floor of the facility.\n\nHe tells the doctors that he\u2019s terrified of Frank, the monster under his bed.\n\n[x](http://davidmaloneystories.com)", "comments": [{"id": "du8e0r4", "author": "2BrkOnThru", "body": "I think Frank should sleep on the bed and make Gary sleep on the floor."}, {"id": "du8cg6t", "author": "janusgang", "body": "I like these nosleep posts that make me warm and fuzzy inside"}, {"id": "du8o4ok", "author": "Theblackcrown95", "body": "Anyone else picturing Frank as danny devito?
