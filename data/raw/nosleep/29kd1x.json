I just received another message, and it\u2019s worse than any of the others. \n\nMy girlfriend died on the 7th of August, 2012. She was involved in a three car collision driving home from work when someone ran a red light. She passed away within minutes on the scene.\n\nWe had been dating for five years at that point. She wasn\u2019t big on the idea of marriage (it felt archaic, she said, gave her a weird vibe), but if she had been, I would have married her within three months of our relationship. She was vibrant; the kind of girl that would choose dare every time. She was happiest when camping, but a total technophile too. She always smelled like cinnamon.\n\nThat being said, she wasn\u2019t perfect. She always said something along the lines of, \u201cIf I kark it first, don\u2019t just say good things about me. I\u2019ve never liked that. If you don\u2019t pay me out, you\u2019re doing me a disservice. I\u2019ve got so many flaws, and that\u2019s just part of me.\u201d So, this is for Em: the music she said she liked and the music she actually liked were very different. Her idea of affection was a side-hug. She had really long toes, like a chimpanzee. \n\nI know that\u2019s tangential, but I don\u2019t feel right discussing her without you having an idea of what she was like. \n\nOnto the meat. Em had been dead for approaching thirteen months when she first messaged me. \n\n---\n[**September 4, 2013.**](http://i.imgur.com/UMh0nZl.png) This is when it began. I had left Emily\u2019s Facebook account activated so I could send her the occasional message, post on her wall, go through her albums. It felt too final (and too un-Emily) to memorialise it. I \u2018share\u2019 access with her mother (Susan) - meaning, her mother has her login and password and has spent a total of approximately three minutes on the website (or on a computer, total). After a little confusion, I assumed it was her.\n\n---\n[**November 16th, 2013.**](http://i.imgur.com/y0yzVaj.png) I had received confirmation from Susan that she hadn\u2019t logged in to Em\u2019s Facebook since the week of her death. Em knew a lot of people, so I instantly assumed this was one of her more tech savvy \u2018friends\u2019 fucking with me in the worst possible way. \n\nI noticed pretty much immediately that whoever was chatting with me was recycling old messages from [Em and my\u2019s shared chat history.](http://i.imgur.com/fw80ZJG.png)\n\nThe \u2018the wheels on the bus' comment was from when we were discussing songs to play on a road trip that never eventuated. \u2018hello\u2019 happened a million times.\n\n---\nAround **February 2014**, Emily started tagging herself in my photos. I would get notifications for them, but the tag would generally always be removed by the time I got to it. The first time I actually caught one, it felt like someone had punched me in the gut. \u2018She\u2019 would tag herself in spaces where it was plausible for her to be, or where she would usually hang out. I\u2019ve got screenshots of two (from April and June; these are the only ones I\u2019ve caught, so they\u2019re a little out of the timeline I\u2019m trying to write out):\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/X9G5agJ.png\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/55FwXKt.png\n\nAround this period of time, I stopped being able to sleep. I was too angry to sleep. \n\nShe would tag herself in random photos every couple of weeks. The friends who noticed and said something thought it was a fucked up bug; I found out recently that there have been friends who have noticed and didn\u2019t say anything. Some of them have removed me from their Facebook friends list.\n\nAt this point, some of you may be wondering why I didn\u2019t just kill my Facebook profile. I wish I had. I did for a little while. On days when I can\u2019t get out there, though, it\u2019s nice having my friends available to chat. It\u2019s nice visiting Em\u2019s page when the little green circle isn\u2019t next to her name. I was already socially reclusive when Em was alive; her death turned me into something pretty close to a hermit, and Facebook and MMOs were (are) my only real social outlets.\n\n---\n[On **March 15th,**](http://i.imgur.com/KIL2Mx5.png) I sent what I assumed was Em's hacker a message.\n\n---\n[**On March 25th**, I received an \u2018answer\u2019.](http://i.imgur.com/j3HwZzv.png)\n\nIt wasn\u2019t until I was going over these logs a few months later that I noticed she was recycling my own words as well.\n \nMy response seems kind of lacklustre here. I was intentionally providing him/her with emotional \u2018bait\u2019 (\u2018This is actually devastating\u2019) to keep them interested in their game; I was working off the assumption that the kind of person to do this would be the kind of person that would thrive on the distress of others. I was posting in tech forums, looking for ways to track this person, contacting Facebook. I needed to keep them around so I could gather \u2018evidence\u2019.\n\nBefore anyone asks, yes, I had changed the password and all security info countless times.\n\n---\n[**16th of April.** I receive this.](http://i.imgur.com/uvadlGa.png)\n\nThis seems like word salad. Like all our conversations so far, it\u2019s recycled from previous messages she\u2019s sent.\n\n---\n[**29th of April.**](http://i.imgur.com/FGmhuUQ.png)\n\nI hadn\u2019t discovered any leads. Facebook had told me the locations her page had been accessed from, but since her death, they\u2019re all places I can account for (my home, my work, her mum\u2019s house, etc). My response here wasn\u2019t bait. \u2018yo ask Nathan\u2019 was an in-joke too lame worth explaining, but seeing \u2018her\u2019 say it again just absolutely fucking crippled me. My reaction in real life was much less prettier. I\u2019m not expecting my bond back.\n\nHer last few messages had started to scare me, but I wouldn\u2019t admit it at this point.\n\n---\n[**8th of May.** I don\u2019t really have the words for this.](http://i.imgur.com/GNL8TcO.png)\n\n\u2018FRE EZIN G\u2019 is the first original word she\u2019s (?) made. This has given me nightmares that have only started to kick in recently. I keep dreaming that she\u2019s in an ice cold car, frozen blue and grey, and I\u2019m standing outside in the warmth screaming at her to open the door. She doesn\u2019t even realise I\u2019m there. Sometimes her legs are outside with me.\n\n---\n[**24th of May.**](http://i.imgur.com/z295fHw.png)\n\nI wasn\u2019t actually drunk. She wasn\u2019t an affectionate girl, and it always embarrassed her to exchange \u2018I love you\u2019s, cuddle, talk about how much we meant to each other. She was more comfortable with it when I was boozed up. I got fake-drunk a lot.\n\nHer reply is what prompted me to finally memorialise her page, thinking it might help curb this behaviour. It might seem innocuous compared to her previous message - it\u2019s pasted from an old conversation where I was trying to convince her to let me drive her home from a friend\u2019s. \n\nIn the collision, the dashboard had crushed her. She was severed in a diagonal line from her right hip to midway down her left thigh. One of her legs was found tucked under the backseat. \n\n---\n[**Going back in time. 7th of August, 2012.**](http://i.imgur.com/ujUNJQm.png)\n\nThese are logs from the day she died. She was usually home from work by 4.30. This, alongside a couple of voicemail messages, is the last time I talked to her under the assumption that she was alive. You\u2019ll see why I\u2019m showing you these soon.\n\n---\n[**Yesterday. 1st of July, 2014.**](http://imgur.com/W6qzAZI)\n\nI memorialised her page a couple of days after I received the message about walking. Until today, she\u2019d been quiet; she wasn\u2019t even tagging herself in my photos. \n\nI don\u2019t know what to do anymore. Do I kill her memorial page? What if it is her? I want to puke. I don\u2019t know what\u2019s happening. \n\nI just heard a Facebook alert. I'm too afraid to swap windows and check it.\n", "comments": [{"id": "cim04aj", "author": "neckbeard_paragon", "body": "Good thing I read this in the middle of the fucking day.

A few years ago when flip phones were still a thing, i got the creepiest text. My best friends Chris' brother Pete (who was like my big brother I never) had killed himself. Fast forward a few years to one day when I was thinking about Pete all day randomly and I receive a text from Chris that says \"so cold 0 chills\" then it said \"freezing\" I replied to Chris saying \"what the hell are you talking about lol\" He didn't reply just another text saying \"where am I?\" It also said \"Pete\" as well but this is going back almost ten years ago so I can't fully remember what else it said. \n\nSo I call Chris laughing saying are you having a stroke or something? He said he has no idea what I'm talking about. So I explain to him the text I got thinking he pocket texted me or something. He checks his phone and nothing is in his sent box. He's FREAKING out saying he didn't send it and starts telling me that he was thinking a lot about Pete the last few days as well. Pete had been dead at least 6 years at this point so it was odd that we both had him heavily on our minds that particular day. Also to receive that text. I know Chris would never and I mean NEVER joke about Pete texting me. He was almost in tears when I read the text. \n\nSo seeing the cold and freezing thing here on a screen sent chills down my spine like i haven't had in a very long time.

You have changed the password multiple times.

You are obviously traumatized by losing someone you care about. Anybody would. It's not outside the realm of possibility that you are suffering mentally from this loss.

As close to proof as we got.\n\nPerhaps, subconsciously, you are unable to let her go. You could very well be disassociating (a common side effect of PTSD) and logging in as her, or suffering from memory lapses, for obvious reasons.\n\nMy thoughts are with you.

She only messages you at night or randomly hours before you get them, and responds instantly when you are stressed from the message. Your friends have defriended you because of it? Maybe because they see the signs that you cant, the way you act or the things you say without you realizing it. Take this as \"food for thought\".\n\nMy advice, seek professional help my friend, the human psyche is nothing to fuck with and you are doing a number on yourself.

At first (in the same year he died) I tried to connect with ghosts on an Ouija board. And had so much success connecting with (probably) spirits, that no one could convince me to thinking there is only the biological form of body that we live in (I do want to advice you against using a Ouija board, but that's another story). After that, I researched a lot about it and found people that could connect to spirits (yes, there are enough people that can deceive you, so watch out). At that time I had dreams of him, mostly dreams of me thinking he was still alive (which was probably my subconscious that didn't wanted to let him go).\nThen I went to a hypnotherapist, who put me under light hypnosis (here you can still fully grasp the situation, not as the hypnosis you see on TV). My friend talked with the therapist through me. You could probably understand how this made me a bit confused. I saw images of him in the car and having the accident in first person. Miguel even said he tried to punch the window, but was not successful. I asked his parents about this fact later, and they told me he had a bloody fist after the accident. Then the therapist finally told him to move on.\n\nMiguel was locked on to me for over 4 years, because I was investigating things about the paranormal. For him it was the easiest way to still be with us for a bit. But it did cost me a lot of energy. After the session until now, I haven\u2019t been as tired as the first 4 years after he was dead.\nAs most people don't believe the stuff I sometime tell about spirits/ghosts (even most of my friends), I mostly don't talk about it. But this is my story about spirits. For me\nthis is one of the reasons why I know life is more than a biological coincidence.\nThis is the summarized version of the things I\u2019ve witnessed in this regard. \n\nMy guess is that she may be stuck in the car accident as a spirit. Or that you still keep here around you because you haven't let her go yet. The only thing you can do is wait, indeed tell her you love her, and she can move on.

Her energy may be strong enough to send signals and messages, but not strong enough to actually input (a.k.a. type) them. And remember what a ghost is, in the purest definition of the word: A lingering piece of the past that can't move on. \n\nPerhaps you aren't really communicating with her in a traditional sense. The cosmos/her energy is just throwing lingering bits and pieces at you. She isn't forming new thoughts... Just regurgitating old ones. If you really, truly want to know, you have to ask her questions. Ask her and she will answer. Never come out and tell her that she is dead, she might not know.\n\nI would recommend gradually moving on and getting back on track with your own life. It's impossible to maintain this connection with the other side and simultaneously live your own life. You'll never meet anyone else, concentrate on a good job, etc. This is a horrible skeleton to have in your closet. Never, ever invite her to come closer. Never. You can always tell her to go away. I know this is a cliche perpetuated by shows like American Horror Story, but if you tell a ghost to GO AWAY most of the time they will listen. I know this from experience.\n\nMore than likely, part of her essence lingers in the network. You might be dealing with a small shell of her old personality: This is not \"her,\" but a shred of her energy trapped in a thing that she was close to. Since she used the account so often, part of her lingers there. If you want to help her (and you) move on, you need to close the account.\n\nFor my own peace of mind, in closing. Go away.
