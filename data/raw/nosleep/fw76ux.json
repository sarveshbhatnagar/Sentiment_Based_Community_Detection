After I acquired a certain revolver from Dale [yesterday](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/fvliz2/working_at_an_amusement_park_twenty_questions/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share), I spent the remainder of the night staring at it. I played around with it a little, harmlessly imitating some rather cool Western scenes. I admit that didn't help me making any sense of it though. \n\nEither way, when I finally went to bed, I took it with me and placed it on my nightstand. For some reason, I felt like I wanted to keep it close to me. \n\nThe revolver has a standard six slot cylinder. When I checked it, I found that there were five rounds in it. This was unsurprising seeing as back in the day, cowboys wouldn't load them fully. From what I know due to my extensive \"research\", and by that I mean hours and hours of watching Westerns, that is because these early revolvers did not have any safety mechanisms and their hammers would always be resting with the striking pin right on the cartridge. \n\nThis meant that a small bump on the hammer would be sufficient to trigger an accidental shot. If one chamber is left empty though, it can be turned to be right in front of the hammer, avoiding the revolver firing on accident. Other than that, I found the adornments in its handle to be quite intriguing as well. While most of them seemed to only serve aesthetic purposes, I also discovered the letters *C* and *M* carved into the shiny, polished wood. \n\nI figured they must be its former owner's initials. The only person I know with their last name to start with an *M* is Dale, but of course I won't say his full name on here. This led me to believe that the revolver must have once belonged to one of his ancestors. I imagine it was handed down over the generations, but for it to be such a valuable heirloom, he sure was suspiciously eager to get rid of it. \n\nWhether he gave it to me as a means of protecting myself against \"upper management\" or with some other hidden intention is beyond me, but I guess I have enough time to find out. After all, Dale and I are now officially on the same side, even though I admit that that gets me thinking: If him and I are in the same boat, then who's in the other one?\n\nThe more I keep thinking about it, the more it confuses me. I believe I should really focus on the facts. \n\nThe first thing I did after getting up this morning was to gather the items Dale had advised me to keep on my person. Iron, laurel, silver, sage, salt and red verbena. Now, I'm not stupid. I am well aware that all of these items hold supernatural meaning. I myself barely have any clue about the occult, but the great thing about having a lot of friends and acquaintances is that there's always this one person who's got just the thing you need. \n\nIn my case, this person's name is Clara. Clara and I met in high school. We used to be pretty close back then and I helped her study from time to time, an act of cordiality she apparently never forgot. When I called her this morning to ask if she could hook me up with some things I needed, she was more than happy to help. Clara has practiced paganism for a long time now, and if there's *one* person who I know will take me serious when showing up on their doorstep asking for sage and red fucking verbena, it's her.\n\nLong story short, I drove over to her place, we had breakfast together and enjoyed some small talk before cutting to the chase. She disappeared into her bedroom for a few minutes before returning with a satchel, a weird looking bundle and a small jewelry box. She placed the three items on the table in front of us and sat down next to me.\n\n\"Okay, first things first,\" she began, picking up the small bundle and holding it out to me. \"This is sage. It's mostly used for cleansing rituals, basically the go-to thing if you want to rid a place of negative energy.\"\n\n\"And how do I do that? Do I just... leave it there or...?\"\n\nClara chuckled and shook her head. \"You burn it, silly. Next up,\" she held up the satchel, \"red verbena. Freshly picked from the pots on my balcony. It offers protection from the evil eye.\"\n\n*Whatever that is*, I added in my mind. \"What's in the jewelry box?\" I inquired.\n\nClara smiled mysteriously. \"I'm glad you asked. See, when you mentioned the silver and iron thing, it reminded me of a certain accessoire I've had lying around here for ages.\" She picked up the box and opened it to produce a shiny, ornate necklace with a heart-shaped locket attached to it. \"Now, the chain itself is iron, but the locket is silver. Great for protection, but sadly not my style, which is why I've decided that you may have it. You seem to need it more than I do after all.\"\n\n\"For real?\" I asked, taking the necklace and carefully opening and closing its locket. \n\n\"Yup! But the best is yet to come.\" My friend opened the satchel and took out a couple of bright red blossoms which she stuffed into the silver locket. She motioned for me to turn around and went about fixing the piece of jewelry around my neck. \"This way, you'll have some silver, iron *and* red verbena with you wherever you go!\"\n\nI smiled at her. \"Thank you so much... I don't know what to say.\"\n\n\"Then shut up!\" she replied and we started giggling and high-fived. We had made this joke all the time back in our school days.\n\n\"About the salt, you can simply use your own. You know, plain salt you use for cooking, it'll do. I don't have any bay laurel around, but I know that when burned, it's good for cleansing and purification rituals. Also, it's known to be useful for breaking curses and hexes,\" she explained. \n\nI thanked her once again and got ready to leave, but she held me back. \"One more thing. So, if I got it right, you don't know what you're dealing with here, but you *do* know the means of protecting yourself from it. Of course, I'm not in your place and you should always proceed with an open mind, but you should probably know that... iron and red verbena are specifically linked to the fae. They repel faeriefolk.\"\n\nClara gave me a moment to process her words before continuing. \"Most say that they dislike iron because it's a material forged by humans while faeries themselves are creatures of nature, but I've also heard of another belief claiming that the faeries once made a deal with the iron and didn't hold up their end of the bargain, so the iron is still angry with them. Who knows. My point is that what you're describing sounds an awful lot like them.\"\n\n\"Alright... do faeries not understand games and half-truths by any chance?\"\n\nClara frowned. \"No. Actually, they're known to be tricksters. You've got to be crazy careful when talking to them since they tend to play around with exact wording and stuff to screw you over. It's very important not to offend them. They're spiteful little...\" she lowered her voice, \"*bastards*. You never know when they might be listening.\"\n\n\"Now you're just trying to scare me.\" \n\nClara winked and opened the door for me, seeing me out. \"You should come back sometime to chat some more,\" she called after me cheerfully and I gave an affirmative thumbs-up as I ventured down the stairs in her apartment building's hallway. \n\nMy next stop was once again my neighbor's place. The elderly lady opened the door for me with a knowing smile. \"Well, if it isn't Leah. Need some more laurel?\" she offered with a grin.\n\n\"Yes, actually I've been thinking... could I buy one of your potted bays maybe?\" I inquired, fumbling for my wallet.\n\nThe lady was a bit taken aback, but willingly went for her living room and came back with a small laurel tree in a pot. She had some trouble dragging it to the doorstep, so I quickly took it from her, lifting it up with ease. I gave her thirty bucks for it. She had only asked for ten, but I told her I had to make up for all the inconveniences my pestering for twigs had caused her these last few days.\n\nLater, I covered up every mirror in my house either by removing them and turning them around or by cloaking them with bedsheets and the like. My reasoning behind this is that whatever came over me in that restroom happened after I was staring at my reflection for too long, so I should probably avoid seeing it for a little while. Normally, I'd think that what happens in the park stays there, but after the incident with Dale yesterday, who says that upper management isn't able to influence me at any given time and place?\n\nI went to work today wearing the verbena locket, my backpack filled with iron nails, bay laurel and cooking salt I had refilled into a small jar. There was one more thing I did though before getting on my way: I called Anne.\n\nShe greeted me as cheerfully as ever, as if the creepy bathroom incident had never taken place. \"Hi! How are you doing? Still violent?\"\n\nI grinned. \"No, no, I'm fine. Hey, is there any chance I could see the Mime today?\"\n\n\"Ah, sorry, but I'm not in today. I'm at my mom's, it's her birthday... but I'd gladly get you to him tomorrow!\"\n\nI told her that would probably do and thanked her, figuring I'd focus on the Aged Diva and the Pianist for the time being. I was less than willing to face the Mime by myself, but the pretenders from the Hollywood section aren't nearly as threatening in my opinion.\n\nI got to the park at around eleven. After minding the sock puppet, I went back for Hollywood. I had never really noticed how creepy it looked with nobody on the streets. The only sound that broke the silence was the quiet melody of the piano, which grew louder and louder the closer I got to the restaurant the Pianist resides in. Looking in through the building's glass front however, I stopped in my tracks. I could not only see the man in the white tuxedo sitting on his stool as usual, there was also another pretender present. The Aged Diva. \n\nI had never seen the two of them so close to one another before. The woman was elegantly leaning against the piano, cigarette in hand, watching her companion play. To my surprise, he wasn't completely ignoring her either, in fact, he would glance up at her with a smile from time to time. I squinted. This was very unusual. They looked so natural together, almost like they were two normal people interacting. But even more interestingly, they looked like they *knew* each other.\n\nIf I'm correct in my assumption that all the not-actors used to be human at some point, then these two must have had a shared past. This got me thinking. If the Pianist knew the Diva and the Diva knew the Laughing Cowboy, would that mean that all of the pretenders' lives used to be connected in some way?\n\nI decided to think about it later. For now, it would be best to take this opportunity and talk to them. If you can call that talking, that is. \n\nI pushed open the door and stepped inside, causing the elderly lady to whirl around. The Pianist however didn't even look up at me.\n\n\"Um... hello,\" I greeted them awkwardly. \"Sir... and ma'am.\"\n\nThe Diva caught herself pretty quickly and straightened up. \"Why hello, darling! So nice of you to come by and visit us,\" she said in her usual, exaggerated manner. \n\n\"Us?\" I inquired. Her usage of this word had immediately struck me as off. *Us*.\n\nShe tilted her head, ignoring my question. \"Won't you sit with me?\" she offered, pointing at a table nearby. \n\n\"Gladly,\" I replied, sliding onto the bench and waiting for her to sit down across from me. Opening my backpack, I took out the iron nail and held it out for her. I'm not sure what I was expecting, but she simply took it out of my hand and inspected it for a while before giving it back to me. She didn't say a word, just kept smiling. I cleared my throat. \"Anything weird about that nail?\" I offered. \n\nThe Diva looked at me like I was stupid. \"Why, is there?\" she asked. \n\nI shook my head. \"Uh... no.\" Seeing as I already knew how she reacted to the bay leaves, I handed her the silver earrings. She seemed to like them a lot better, holding them up against the early noon sunlight streaming in through the window. \n\n\"Why, aren't they lovely! You sure have a good taste in fashion, dearie,\" she praised me before dropping them into my hollow hand again.\n\n*Well, that was underwhelming,* I thought, but decided to simply move on to the Pianist. He didn't react to any of the items except for the laurel twig. When I held it out to him, he promptly turned in his seat. He kept playing the piano eagerly, but leaned away as far from the bay leaves as he could. It was sort of entertaining and I couldn't help but play around with this effect a little, sticking the twig out to him from either side just to see how far he could lean over without ceasing to play.\n\nI finally decided that enough was enough and put the laurel twig away. I wasn't ready to leave though. It was weird how *aware* the two had seemed of one another when they had been by themselves. So I asked, \"Not to be intrusive, but are you two together or something?\"\n\nThe Pianist didn't react, but the Aged Diva instantly looked up. She opened her mouth as if to say something, but the only thing that escaped her lips was a dry, throaty choking noise. \n\n\"We...\" she cawed, before suddenly throwing her head back and gagging. \"We...\" she pressed out, \"dear... ie...\"\n\nI took a step back. I hadn't seen her like this before. \"What's... happening to you?\" I stammered, unsure of what to do. Normally, her face would melt off, *that* I was used to. But this?\n\nI was almost relieved when I saw her wrinkled skin slowly flow downwards, her scalp following soon after. Then a loud *pop*, and she was gone. I stared in shock at the glittering spot where she had just been standing. It was like she had been trying to tell me something this time. I shuddered and backed out of the restaurant, for some reason not daring to take my eyes off the Pianist. For a split second, I thought I could see something glinting in the corner of his eye.\n\nI made my way over to Dale's office. I wasn't sure if he was in already, but to my surprise, I found him leaning against its door from outside, sipping from a bottle of what looked to be ice tea. \n\n\"There you are,\" he greeted me, cracking me a half-hearted smile. \"Took you long enough.\"\n\n\"It's good to see you too, Dale.\"\n\n\"Right. Hey, now that we're best friends and all that shit, there's one more thing I wanna show you,\" he explained. \"Um... before you give me back my gun,\" he quickly added.\n\nI nodded and he came a bit closer to me. He sat down his water bottle and pulled up his left sleeve. There was another carving in his lower arm. This one wasn't as deep as the *My name is Dale* ones though. It looked to be pretty fresh, there was even a bit of blood dripping from one of the cuts. \n\n*3/8.*\n\n\"Three out of -\" I was just about to say it out loud, but before I knew it, Dale was pressing his hand onto my mouth.\n\n\"Ssh!\" he hissed. \"Will you shut your ass up? Fucking hell.\"\n\n\"Sorry,\" I mumbled into his palm. He rolled his eyes and slowly removed it from my lips. \"But what does it mean?\" I asked under my breath. \n\nDale motioned for me to stay quiet. \"Can't tell. All I want you to know is that you need to keep your mind, like, *wide* open. Don't generalize, stick to what you know. And be careful. I can't believe I'm saying this but...\" he paused to let go of a soft sigh. He looked genuinely worried. \"I'd hate for you to get hurt.\"\n\nSuddenly, he began to fumble in his pocket only to produce his keys. His eyes had become glazed and empty and I watched in shock as he proceeded to lift the sharp object and slam it down onto his left palm with such force that it pierced the flesh. He regained conciousness soon after, told me to leave him alone and that he would take care of it.\n\nAfter this rather bizarre conversation, I gave him back his gun and went for the last thing on my to-do list for the day.\n\nI found Nathan slumped over in his coachseat, fast asleep. The horses were calmly standing in the shade of the entrance to the wooden rollercoaster in Twin Vale Point. I swung myself onto the seat next to him and quietly said his name in an attempt to wake him up, but was unable to receive any reaction apart from the occasional snore. \n\nHe looked peaceful and I didn't really want to startle him, so I merely took the stork plushie out of my backpack and placed it in his lap, right next to where his hands were resting. To my surprise, his fingers almost immediately curled around it. I couldn't help but smile at the sight.\n\nr/CrypticPark\n\n[Part 17: iron](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/fwsv71/working_at_an_amusement_park_the_thing_about_iron/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share)", "comments": [{"id": "fmmm2pp", "author": "NoSleepAutoBot", "body": "It looks like there may be more to this story.

A part of me says he\u2019s more involved with upper management than we think.

If Dale was being controlled by upper management at that time, it doesn\u2019t seem beneficial to them to try to drive a wedge between you and the cowboy if you need to feel connected to him to transform.

And Dale too.\n\nAlso, I'm not really very good with theories, but what if the pretenders are able to act 'normally' when they're not being watched by actors or visitors? Like how Diva and Pianist were hitting it off while no one was around, but revert back to their creepy/useless selves when in the company of someone who isn't like them?\n\nMaybe Nathan is able to understand and talk to them a little better than a 'normal' person/actor? As long as he does it by himself?\n\nFinally, about the 3/8 deal. If I remember correctly (which I'm probably not TBH), the Cowboy, The Diva and the Nurse are the only pretenders who have been 'useful' investigation-wise (I'm not counting Nathan as a pretender), so 3 out of a possible 8 allies have been discovered by Upper Management, maybe?"}, {"id": "fmo0x3y", "author": "RedChlo11111", "body": "All I keep thinking is that the cowboy is bad and he is luring you in to change you..

I'd be very wary of anything strange you have a strong urge to do. I'm worried that in order for the ritual or whatever to succeed you have to be doing it yourself.

I mean, if she can acknowledge people and other things, like the earrings and certain verbal comments directed at her, why would it be so strange that she can aknowledge being with another entity like the pianist?

Let me take a moment and offer you a word of caution. The Supernatural is not how fiction portrays it.  Supernatural entities have to abide by laws. Not laws like keep off the grass or only pass in the left lane but rather the Laws of Physics. One such law is of belief or faith. Once someone believes in the Supernatural they open themselves up making them vulnerable to manipulation of Physical, Emotional, or Mental nature. Once you believe there is no turning back.  \n\n\nYou know that Dale's family formed a deal with something. That narrows the field on what you are looking for. Fae, Devils, and Demons. There are older entities that have made deals with mortals but they don't have a unified category. Knowing what you are dealing with doesn't mean it can be stopped either. People who have devoted their life to the study of such things rarely survive and attempt to disrupt them.    \n\n\nYou keep mentioning the Iron nails, but are you sure you have iron nails? Most modern nails are made of steel. When turning Iron into steel something happens. In some folklore the Iron has to be wrought. My understanding from these superstitions adding carbon or melting down the iron causes it to lose something. Wrought Iron is heated and worked but never melted down so its as close to the natural ore as you will get.  \n\n\nA word about your new necklace. Keep it touching your skin and out of sight. Don't tell anyone about it and keep note of anyone who notices the chain around you neck. It may offer some protection but I feel it will be more useful identifying those working against you. Not all of the actors are your friends. Some of them may be more involved than you can understand.   \n   \nI leave you with this small warning. I know you want to help Nathan and solve this mystery. I believe your hiring or discovering the position was not by accident. What ever it is, its scope and reach are much further than the park. You may have been chosen for some reason and Upper management it using this mystery and now Nathan to keep you coming back. So with that said I would tell you to run away and forget the park and everything you know but, its grip on your will prevent you from doing just that. Anyway stay safe."}, {"id": "fmq4j65", "author": "Lil_misspoundcake", "body": "Seems suspicious that Dale asked you what your name was. Makes me think everything he does is to ultimately deceive you to think that he\u2019s not part of the fae or to even question it.

Maybe he really is the one pulling all the strings here."}, {"id": "fmq8lvf", "author": "Namastdoge", "body": "I dunno if someone else said this and I might be reading way to far into it but Oliver flys way to far under the radar for my liking."}]}
