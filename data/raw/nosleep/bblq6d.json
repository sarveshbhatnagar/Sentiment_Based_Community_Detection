Why couldn\u2019t he just answer?* I took a deep breath, tried to remain calm.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll be all right,\u201d I said, \u201cas soon as you tell me where my daughter is.\u201d\n\nMy husband frowned, and the little girl\u2019s eyes welled up with moisture. My husband placed a protective hand over her shoulder, and leaned down to whisper in her ear. \n\n\u201cGo on upstairs, honey,\u201d he said. \u201cMommy\u2019s not feeling well.\u201d\n\nThe girl wasted no time in doing what he said. She clutched her schoolbooks to her chest and barreled past me, rushing up the stairs. I heard the door of my daughter\u2019s room slam. The look on my husband\u2019s face was a mix of pity and restrained anger.\n\n\u201cYou haven\u2019t been taking your medication,\u201d he said. \u201cDon\u2019t try to deny it, I can see it in your eyes.\u201d\n\nI waved my hand in a dismissive gesture. \n\n\u201cI don\u2019t need them,\u201d I said. \u201cThey make my mind all fuzzy.\u201d\n\nThe anger on my husband\u2019s face became less restrained. Well-etched frown lines beneath his lips deepened. \n\n\u201cDo you remember what happened the last time you said that?\u201d he asked. \n\n\u201cI...\u201d\n\nThe suggestion was enough. A swarm of shattered and confused images flooded my mind, like the wave of nausea that comes before vomit. My husband screaming, covered in blood.\n\n*Look what you made me do!* he was shrieking. *Look what you made me do!*\n\nI felt the floor tilt beneath me, and before I knew what had happened, I found myself falling backwards into my husbands arms. Hot tears were streaming down my cheeks, and my body convulsed with violent sobs.\n\nMy husband gently brushed my hair and whispered in my ear.\n\n\u201cShhh,\u201d he cooed. \u201cIt\u2019s not real, honey. I promise that it\u2019s not real.\u201d\n\nI silently nodded my assent. I let him carry me up to our bedroom and lay me gently down on the bed. He walked over to the dresser where he kept the cocktail of drugs that I took every day to maintain my sanity. I swallowed them gratefully. \n\nSoon my mind was going fuzzy, I could feel myself becoming a pliable zombie that could be told anything, made to do anything. \n\nOf course I knew that it was wrong, that that girl was not Liza. I knew that it wasn\u2019t me who had been driven insane by our daughter\u2019s death, but my husband. I knew he had kidnapped that girl when she was a toddler, and brainwashed her into believing she was Liza.\n\nBut, most importantly, I knew that if I didn\u2019t take my pills, if I shattered his precariously built illusion, that he would kill the girl and start all over again.\n\nJust like he did the last time.\n\n[x](http://reddit.com/r/lifeisstrangemetoo)", "comments": [{"id": "ekjrnvc", "author": "Lemebeme", "body": "The mom could suffer from Capgras delusion, which is a very rare mental illness in which someone believes their loved ones have been replaced with imposters pretending to be them"}, {"id": "ekkhlp1", "author": "texasplumr", "body": "Wow! This is great and it hits home for me.\n\nGrowing up in the 50s and 60s my mother was bipolar. The thing is, they wouldn\u2019t diagnose that until the 80s. They didn\u2019t really know what it was so she wasn\u2019t treated until we were grown. I remember my little sister and I walking home from school, openly discussing which mom would be there to greet us when we got home. \n\nBeing her older brother I would always enter first. I would do my best to protect her if the angry and violent mom was home. My sister was always frightened so if angry mom was home I would always get her attention and my sister could then sneak by and into her room. Surprisingly, it worked most of the time. And the welts from the belt only hurt for a short time. \n\nShe would eventually flip to the kind and caring mother that she was by nature and apologize to me and usually buy us ice cream. And when dad came home from work we were safe. My little  sister would then come out and we\u2019d watch tv and play like normal kids. And we\u2019d look like a normal family.
