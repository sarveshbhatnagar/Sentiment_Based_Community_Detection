She\u2019d been Spacegirl since Grade 2. She was the kind of kid who stuck out in the crowd with her long red hair, ghostly pale skin and coke bottle glasses. For as long as I\u2019d known her, Spacegirl had been quiet. She didn\u2019t like to be around us. She didn\u2019t play with us when we were kids, she didn\u2019t even talk much.  \n\n\nMost of the time, she\u2019d find somewhere to sit, far away from everyone else. Then she\u2019d open up her little notebook and scribble inside of it. Sometimes she wrote poems, sometimes she drew. But she was always off on her own little world. Nowadays, I understand why we targeted her. She was different, and she was alone. That doesn\u2019t justify any of it, but kids can be cruel. I remember that it was Sasha Brown who told me that Spacegirl was retarded because her Mother was on drugs. She probably just made that up. But we all believed it. She had always been the worst towards Spacegirl, and she kept that up until the end.   \n\n\nIt all started in Grade 5 when Sasha took her notebook.\n\nIt had been raining that day, so we\u2019d had an indoor recess. Spacegirl sat in the corner at her desk, eyes focused on her notebook as she methodically worked on a drawing. Sasha and I had been sitting nearby at our desks, and we simply just watched her do her thing.\n\n  \u201cI can\u2019t believe they let that retard sit in with us.\u201d Sasha murmured, \u201cLook at her\u2026 Why do they even let them in schools? They aren\u2019t gonna learn anything.\u201d  \n   \u201cBetter than leaving her at home with her crackhead Mom.\u201d Said Tanya Evrett. She and I weren\u2019t exactly friends, but she sat close to Sasha and I. \u201cMy Dad says he sees a different car in front of her house every day. He says that she lets boys come and they pay her so they can have S-E-X.\u201d None of us could actually say the dreaded S word at the time. Sex was still a terrible unknown thing, and we all had been raised to believe that nobody decent would ever do it.  \n\n\nSpacegirl paused, and her eyes darted away from her book, to look at us. I can only imagine she\u2019d heard us. Sasha just stared right back at her.   \n\n\n  \u201cWhat? Do you have a problem, Spacegirl?\u201d She asked. The Teacher was out of earshot, and that gave her carte blanche to say whatever she wanted. Spacegirl didn\u2019t respond. She just looked back down at her notebook, but Sasha had been challenged (or at least she thought she\u2019d been). She looked over to the Teachers desk to make sure she was busy, then she got up and moved closer to Spacegirl. \n\n  \u201cWhat are you even doing in there, retard?\u201d \n\nShe\u2019d reached out to snatch the book before Spacegirl could stop her. \n\n  \u201cWhat even is this? A Unicorn? What are you, five?\u201d \n\nShe handed the book to me, and I took it on instinct. There was a brightly colored drawing of a Unicorn inside. The artwork was actually pretty nice, but I would never have said so. The book was passed on to Tanya next, and Spacegirl could only look at us helplessly. \n\n  \u201cWow. You can\u2019t even draw. Look at this?\u201d\n\nShe tore the page out of the notebook, and Spacegirl let out a startled whimper, as if she\u2019d been struck. The picture was crumpled up and the book was thrown on the floor by Spacegirls desk.\n\n  \u201cDraw something that isn\u2019t trash next time.\u201d Tanya said, and Sasha just giggled as if it was anything other than being mean spirited just for the sake of it. \n\nSpacegirl slowly picked her book up off the floor, avoiding eye contact as Tanya and Sasha turned away from her. I continued to stare. I remember that the way she moved was so defeated, as if she were shrinking in on herself. She looked up at me, but only for a moment and I felt bad for her. I really did. But I didn\u2019t do anything about it. I just left her to rejoin the others.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAfter that, Spacegirl became an easy target for Sasha and Tanya. Every chance they got, they\u2019d harass her and I regret to admit that I was usually right there with them.\n\nDuring the days where we could go outside for recess, Spacegirl would always sit beneath the same tree, always working in her notebook. When she did, we would always lean on the trunk and look down over Spacegirls shoulder.\n\n  \u201cWow, that\u2019s really good, Spacegirl.\u201d Was how most of her comments would start, \u201cDid you mean to draw it like it got hit by a truck, or is that just your style?\u201d\n\nThere was never a compliment. She would always find something to needle.\n\n  \u201cCan you draw me?\u201d Sasha asked once, \u201cI heard that retards were always like, art geniuses or something. Maybe it\u2019ll even look like a person!\u201d\n\nSpacegirl didn\u2019t look up at her. She seemed to be trying not to acknowledge the insults. I won\u2019t pretend like I was blameless either. I never stopped them, and there were plenty of times where I was right there, making fun of her because that was what we did, and we weren\u2019t the only ones. More or less everyone hurt her in some way or another. But she never complained. I think she was too scared to.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt was late December in 7th grade where things got even worse. I don\u2019t know all the details, and I don\u2019t know just for how long things had been boiling over, but I\u2019d heard a rumor that James Hardy had it out for Spacegirl.  \n\n\nJames had only been in my class a few times, and he wasn\u2019t in my class that year. He was a small, mousy looking kid who was convinced he was the world's toughest gangster. The rumors said that someone had seen his Dad going into Spacegirls house. Naturally there had been speculation that they'd been having sex. Someone told me that James\u2019 parents had been divorcing because of it. Somehow all of these rumors had mutated into claims that James and Spacegirl were dating and I think that was what had rubbed him the wrong way.  \n\n\nWe were coming in from recess when some boys decided to pull a little prank on James. The whole prank had been set up by Brian Jordan and his brother Mike. They had some mistletoe for the Holiday season, and had set it up in the hall leading back to our classroom. Mike had grabbed Spacegirl during recess and were holding her behind the door where the mistletoe was. When James walked through, they pushed her at him and snapped a picture. I\u2019d been just behind James when it happened. I watched as Spacegirl came flying out of seemingly nowhere, eyes wide and afraid, then slammed into James. They both hit the ground, and I could hear the other boys laughing.  \n\n\n  \u201cLOOK! She wanted to give you a kiss!\u201d One the boys said. Spacegirl was trying to crawl away from James and pick up her notebook, but somebody had kicked it out of sight. I remember that she looked back towards James, and there were tears in her eyes. She must have been terrified with everything that was going on. She clearly hadn\u2019t wanted any part in this, but there she was at the center of it.\n\n \u201cYou fucking faggot assholes!\u201d James yelled as he picked himself up.\n\n  \u201cHey, she just wanted to give you a smooch!\u201d aughed Brian, \u201cCome on, give her a kiss!\u201d \n\nSomeone pushed Spacegirl towards James, and he glared at her as if all of this was her fault. She tried to stand and run, but he was angry and he wasn\u2019t thinking straight. I watched as he grabbed her and hit her. A square punch to the jaw. Then he tossed her to the ground and went after Brian next. A teacher had to get in to pull James off of him. He, Spacegirl and the Jordan Brothers ended up getting suspended right before the Christmas holidays. We didn\u2019t see Spacegirl until January\u2026 we didn\u2019t see James or his friends ever again. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nOn Christmas Eve, there was a car accident on the highway outside of my town. Supposedly it had swerved off the road to avoid an animal of some kind, and gone into a ditch. Mike, Brian and their parents didn\u2019t survive. On December 27th, James was killed while outside shoveling his driveway. My Parents told me that he\u2019d been attacked by an animal. Probably a deer or something. But that seemed so unusual\u2026 I\u2019d never heard anything about deer attacking people before. Especially not in my area.  \n\n\nI went over to Sasha\u2019s house on the day before New Years. We\u2019d both gotten some gift cards for Christmas and we were planning to walk to the mall together to use them. Her parents weren\u2019t home, they both had to work. So it was just us when I got there.\n\n  \u201cHey! Kept me waiting!\u201d She said when I knocked on the door.   \n   \u201cSorry.\u201d   \n   \u201cIt\u2019s fine. I\u2019ll be ready in a bit. Come on upstairs, I wanna show you something!\u201d\n\nI didn\u2019t question what it was. I figured it was just something else she\u2019d gotten for Christmas, so I went upstairs with her.\n\n  \u201cYou\u2019re gonna love it.\u201d She promised me, \u201cIt\u2019s gonna be so funny\u2026\u201d\n\nShe led me to her bedroom, and as soon as she opened the door, I spotted a familiar notebook on her desk.  \n   \u201cWhere did you get this?\u201d I asked, walking closer to it.\n\n  \u201cSpacegirl dropped it when Brian and his Brother pulled that prank the other day, she dropped it. I may have grabbed it\u2026 Y\u2019know. Just for safekeeping.\u201d  \n\n\nShe cracked a wry grin, before opening the notebook.  \n\n\n  \u201cLook at this\u2026 She\u2019s been drawing the same damn Unicorns forever. She didn\u2019t even finish this one!\u201d\n\nShe paused at one small picture that was labeled \u2018The Unicorn Prince\u2019. It depicted an empty field with a blank space where the titular Prince should have been. Sasha flipped through the pages a little more until she got to the newer ones.\n\n  \n  \u201cI figured since they kicked Spacegirl out for a little while, and her Mom is too poor to get her anything for the holidays, I\u2019d step up! What do you think?\u201d Sasha wasn\u2019t anywhere near as good of an artist as Spacegirl was, but the simple detail in what she had drawn turned my stomach.\n\n  \nIn her first picture, Spacegirl was hanging from a rope. Her tongue was hanging out, and her eyes were closed.   \nIn the second one, Spacegirl had a gun in her mouth.   \nIn the third one, she was standing on the edge of a building. \n\nSasha giggled as I flipped through her crude depictions of suicide. There were pages of them.\n\n  \u201cWhat do you think?\u201d She asked with a grin, \u201cI\u2019ll bet she\u2019ll lose her shit!\u201d\n\nI closed the notebook and looked over at Sasha.\n\n  \u201cA-are you out of your mind?\u201d I asked. Sasha\u2019s grin faded.\n\n  \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d\n\n  \u201cYou stole her notebook, just so you could draw these? Sasha, that\u2019s really messed up!\u201d  \n   \u201cIt\u2019s Spacegirl, who the hell cares about Spacegirl, Jane?\u201d\n\n  \u201cYou just\u2026 drew her killing herself over and over again!\u201d I took the book off her desk, \u201cDo you not understand what\u2019s wrong with that?\u201d\n\nSasha just stared at me like I was crazy.\n\n  \u201cFine. Sue me for trying to be funny.\u201d Sasha said, \u201cJust give it here\u2026\u201d She outstretched a hand to take the notebook, but I pulled back from her. \n\n  \u201cNo. You\u2019re just going to put something else in there.\u201d\n\nAnger flared in Sasha\u2019s eyes.\n\n  \u201cJane, just give me the book.\u201d\n\n  \u201cNo!\u201d  \n\n\nI opened the book, and I started to tear out those pages of Spacegirls suicide. Sasha lunged for me, trying to grab at the book and stop me, but  pushed her back. I didn\u2019t mean to push so hard, but I did and she fell, landing hard on the ground. For a moment, Sasha looked up at me, wide eyed and shocked. I don\u2019t think anyone had laid a hand on her like that before. Then I saw something in her eyes\u2026 Not just anger. Something worse. It was the same thing that had prompted her to draw those horrible pictures of Spacegirl. I turned and I ran, bolting down her stairs and out her front door, back into the snow. I clutched Spacegirls notebook to my chest the entire time and I didn\u2019t let it go until I got home.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI spent the rest of the Christmas break terrified that my parents would get a call from Sasha\u2019s. I\u2019d pushed her, and that seemed like such a big deal at the time. In hindsight, I doubt Sasha would have told her parents what had happened. They would have asked why I\u2019d pushed her, and I would have told them about the notebook. On some level, she must have known that what she\u2019d done was wrong. She was a cruel person, but there was a limit. Part of me hoped that she\u2019d realize that I was right and we could patch things up when School started again, but honestly I wasn\u2019t so sure.   \n\n\nI remember looking through Spacegirls drawings. The ones that she\u2019d done. I remembered the ones I\u2019d made fun of the most. There was one with a mermaid on a rock, combing her hair. Her eyes were closed in a relaxed bliss. I remembered saying how stupid her facial expression had looked, but honestly, I kinda liked it. I flipped through the pages some more, through Unicorns, Fairies and Castles. But I paused at the page depicting the Unicorn Prince. Back at Sasha\u2019s place, it had been blank, but at my house it was finished. The Unicorn Prince stood proudly in his field, looking skywards with his horn proudly displayed. Maybe I had been thinking of a different picture?  \n\n\nI brushed it off and flipped to the back where Sasha\u2019s pictures were. One by one, I started tearing them out of the notebook and tossing them in the trash. It was a waste of paper, but I refused to give it back to Spacegirl with those images still in it. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nOn the first day back to school, I was up early. I made sure the notebook was packed into my bag and was out as early as I could be. The snow on the ground was almost pristine as I walked to school, but I remember seeing some tracks on my lawn, headed down the side of my house. Deep U shaped indents that looked like they\u2019d been made by hooves. A deer perhaps? I didn\u2019t dwell on them and made my way down the freshly shoveled sidewalk and back to school.   \n\n\nI wasn\u2019t entirely sure if Spacegirl would be back yet, but she was. She was alone in the classroom, sitting at her desk and drawing in a brand new notebook. She paused briefly when I walked in to join her, and I could see her sideying me. She didn\u2019t say a word as I drew nearer, but I thought I saw her shoulders tense up ever so slightly.\n\n  \u201cHey.\u201d I said, \u201cI\u2019m\u2026 I hope you had a nice Holiday.\u201d\n\nShe didn\u2019t respond.\n\n  \u201cI\u2019m sorry about what happened the other day. I didn\u2019t know anything about it, but it just seemed really mean spirited.\u201d\n\nStill no answer. I reached into my backpack, taking out her old notebook. I put it on her desk in front of her. She stared at it, still silent, then back at me.\n\n  \u201cSasha took it. I was over at her house the other day and she showed it to me. I had to take some pages out, but she drew some really awful things in there. I didn\u2019t think it would be right to give it back with those things in there\u2026\u201d I paused, feeling smaller as Spacegirl stared at me. She didn\u2019t seem angry or thankful. She didn\u2019t seem anything at all. Just stoic.\n\n  \u201cI\u2019m sorry if I wasn\u2019t all that great to you before.\u201d I said, and then I shuffled off to by desk. Spacegirl waited until I sat down before she opened her notebook and inspected it. Then she closed her new book, and started something new on a fresh page in her old one. \n\nIt wasn\u2019t much. But it made me feel at least a little good for what I\u2019d done.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhen Sasha got in, she didn\u2019t talk to me. She didn\u2019t even look at me. Neither did Tanya or any of our other mutual friends. I knew from the moment they walked in that I\u2019d burned my bridges with them. But I still wanted to try.\n\nThe Teacher hadn\u2019t come in yet, so I figured it might be worth it to try and talk to Sasha. I got up to move closer to her and she gave me a look of utter disgust.  \n\n\n  \u201cWhat do you want?\u201d She spat. \n\nNow it was my turn to be silent.  \n\n\n  \u201cFuck off and leave us alone.\u201d Tanya said, \u201cYou\u2019d obviously rather hang out with the fucking retard than us, and I really don\u2019t want you spreading your retard germs to us. It\u2019s a quarantine issue.\u201d   \n\n\nI stared at both of them, and I could\u2019ve sworn I knew how Spacegirl felt\u2026 What was I supposed to say to any of that? Instead, I just returned to my desk without a word. Spacegirl stared at me the entire time. Her pencil rested over her notebook, but she didn\u2019t write anything. She set it down, tore out the page she\u2019d been writing on and jammed it into her pocket. I later saw her toss it into the trash during lunch.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI didn\u2019t really have anyone left\u2026 So I thought that maybe it might be a good idea to pull it out. Maybe it was something she wasn\u2019t happy with? I\u2019d never seen her throw a drawing out before. I was thinking that maybe I could use it as a peace offering of sorts, or something along those lines. When I saw what she\u2019d written on it, I almost threw it back into the trash.   \n\n\n**Your Words**\n\n*There is a land where your sorry may go.*\n\n*A sickening land where it always snows*\n\n*The snow is putrid in color and smell*\n\n*It's substance- filth and things I won't tell.*\n\n*Only your Father has been there before.*\n\n*One day your boyfriend will visit once more.*\n\n*This place in your carcass this humanoid hell.*\n\n*Your sorry can go there to this hole in your shell*\n\n*My unsubtle message, this subtextual jazz.*\n\n*Is take your apology and stuff it up your ass.*  \n\n\nThis was unlike anything I\u2019d ever seen her write. It was so crass and spiteful\u2026 This was as close to hatred as she could have gotten. I understood why she\u2019d thrown it out. It didn\u2019t fit with everything else she\u2019d done. Those things had been beautiful, despite what people had said to her. This was angry and ugly\u2026 This was something she\u2019d written for me. I put it in my pocket. I wasn\u2019t going to give it back to her, but I wanted to keep it. I wanted to remember the way I\u2019d made her feel. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEighth grade wasn\u2019t fun for me. \n\nI had very few friends left, and Sasha never forgave me for turning on her. Her version of the story was slowly warped as time went on. First I\u2019d punched her and stolen the book. Then I\u2019d tried to kiss her, punched her when she\u2019d refused, then stole the book to try and get her in trouble. Rumors of me being a dyke spread pretty quickly, and hot on their heels came the rumors that I was dating Spacegirl. I tried not to let them bother me too much. I knew the truth and at the end of the day, I\u2019d done the right thing.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBy the time High School rolled around, I was hoping for a fresh start. There were new faces, and I figured I could make friends with them before Sashas rumors spread. I had a bit of success in that department. I fell in with a better crowd at least.   \n\n\nSasha stuck with her same old clique. It grew ever so slightly, but she was determined to live out the movie Mean Girls and most people didn\u2019t pay her any mind.   \nSpacegirl barely changed at all. I didn\u2019t see her much when High School started. She was in a few of my classes, but I rarely saw her outside of them. Whenever she had a moment, she\u2019d be in the library, usually in one of the corner cubicles, working on her drawings. Sometimes I thought about talking to her and trying to strike up a friendship\u2026 but it never felt right.   \n\n\nSasha\u2019s bullying never let up of course. Of course she stalked Spacegirl to the library where she\u2019d pull the same old shit she\u2019d been pulling since the fifth grade. She\u2019d leer over her cubicle and comment on her drawings. Picking them apart just like she always had. I stopped her whenever I saw it\u2026 but I didn\u2019t always see it.\n\n  \u201cComing to her rescue again, huh Jane?\u201d Sasha asked once when I\u2019d interrupted her. Tanya leered at me from behind her, chewing gum with her mouth open. \n\n  \u201cWhat\u2019s she ever done to you anyways?\u201d I asked, \u201cShe\u2019s just minding her own business.\u201d\n\n  \u201cOh? What\u2019s she done to you, dyke?\u201d Sasha hissed. She leaned down over her cubicle and looked down at the notebook.\n\n  \u201cUnicorns\u2026 Unicorns, unicorns, fucking unicorns\u2026 When are you going to grow up Spacegirl?\u201d  \n   \u201cHey! I told you to stop.\u201d I rounded the cubicle and I saw Sasha recoil. For a moment, I saw a bit of fear in her eyes. It vanished quickly and was replaced with a familiar rage.  \n\n\n  \u201cFine.\u201d She said, \u201cTan, let\u2019s leave the happy couple to their alone time.\u201d  \nShe pulled away from the cubicle and disappeared with Tanya nipping at her heels like a faithful terrier. \n\nSpacegirl remained hunched over her notebook, her long red hair spilling over her shoulders. She seemed impossibly still.\n\nI turned to leave her when I heard:\n\n  \u201cThanks.\u201d\n\nI looked back at her and saw that she was looking at me.\n\n  \u201cUm\u2026 You\u2019re welcome.\u201d I said, \u201cLet me know if she bothers you again, alright?\u201d\n\n  \u201cI will. But\u2026 you\u2019re usually there anyways.\u201d \n\nHer voice was soft and low. I\u2019d heard it before, but I don\u2019t remember her ever speaking directly to me.\n\n  \u201cYeah, well. It\u2019s just not right. She\u2019s such a child. One of these days she\u2019s going to have to grow up.\u201d\n\nSpacegirl just nodded, looking over towards the library door, then back down at her notebook again. \n\nFor a moment, I thought about asking her about what she was drawing. I thought about saying something else, but\u2026 No. I didn\u2019t want to make her uncomfortable. I left her alone again. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nIn tenth grade, I took art as an elective. I wasn\u2019t much of an artist, but I figured it would be an easy course. To the surprise of no one, Spacegirl was there. I actually asked her to work with me on a few group projects. I think the prospect of being asked to work together was foreign to her. She looked at me suspiciously when I did it, but when she smiled, it was the biggest smile I\u2019d ever seen.  \n\n\nI went to her house for the first time to work on a portrait project with her once. We were supposed to take turns drawing portraits of each other and I\u2019d volunteered to let her draw me first. Rumors of her Mother had always surrounded Spacegirl, so I wasn\u2019t entirely sure what to expect when I got there. I certainly wasn\u2019t expecting the quiet, neatly kept house that I found.  \n\n\nThe Woman who answered the door looked like an older version of her daughter, sans the coke bottle glasses.\n\n  \u201cYou must be Jane.\u201d She said. She wasn\u2019t smiling, but she didn\u2019t sound upset either.\n\n  \u201cYes ma\u2019am\u2026\u201d\n\n  \u201cCome on in. Megan's upstairs. She was just getting ready for you.\u201d\n\nThe house was warm with plenty of knick knacks on the walls. Plates and porcelain dolls mostly. Her Mom sent me upstairs and I didn't waste any time. On the landing leading up to Spacegirls room, I could see a mural of family photos and paused to look at them. I could recognize Spacegirl and her Mother in most of them. Spacegirl never seemed to be smiling. I only saw her Father in a few of the very early pictures. Spacegirl looked like she was only a young child in the few pictures I saw him in though. I didn\u2019t dwell for long and headed towards what I assumed was her room. The cardboard stars and planets on it gave it away.  \n\n\nSure enough, she was inside waiting for me. She sat facing the door behind an easel in the center of her room. Her bed was neatly made and tucked away in the corner. She had a clean little desk that she\u2019d clearly been working on and had set a chair out for me to sit on. I hadn\u2019t expected something so overwhelmingly formal and I almost started laughing\u2026 But then I noticed her walls.  \n\n\nThey weren\u2019t just covered in drawings. The art pieces on them were full on paintings. They were the same fantasy depictions she usually did, but the colors were so vivid. The clouds looked like fluffy pillows and the castles seemed great and infinite.\n\n  \u201cHoly shit, are these yours?\u201d\n\n  \u201cThey are.\u201d Spacegirl said softly. She stood up and took the plate of cookies from me, then moved it to her desk.\n\n  \u201cIt\u2026 it\u2019s soothing.\u201d She said after a while, \u201cPainting, I mean. I pick the drawings I like the most and\u2026 I finish them.\u201d\n\nShe spoke slowly, like she was carefully choosing her words. I almost felt like there was something that she was trying to avoid. I spotted a painting on the floor that looked like her Father. The style was the same but the content was different. He was surrounded by awkward scribbles, and he looked completely and utterly terrified. Spacegirl looked down at it, but she seemed to disapprove of it. She turned it around so I wouldn\u2019t have to look at it.  \n\n\n  \u201cWe should get started.\u201d She said, \u201cSorry\u2026\u201d\n\n  \u201cNo, it\u2019s alright!\u201d I said. I sat in the chair for her. \u201cI\u2019d like to hear about it.\u201d\n\nSpacegirl watched me from the corner of her eye for a moment, as if she doubted I was being serious. But eventually she sat down behind the easel and started to draw\u2026 Soon after that, she was talking too. I stayed long after she\u2019d gotten what she needed for her sketch, just to talk. She told me that she\u2019d always liked fantasy, and how she liked Unicorns because they were simple but pretty. I hung on to every word, and I could\u2019ve sworn I saw her smiling shyly as she talked.   \n\n\nThe portrait she\u2019d done of me was something else entirely. Her work had always been beautiful\u2026 but this made me look transcendent. I wasn\u2019t entirely sure that I was looking at myself at first. There was something about the look on my face. There was a small, almost content smile there. The warmth it conveyed was almost disney-esque.\n\n  \u201cI love it.\u201d I told her, \u201cThat\u2019s incredible Spa\u2026 Megan\u2026 That\u2019s really great!\u201d\n\n  \u201cYou can call me Spacegirl if you want.\u201d She said, \u201cI don\u2019t mind the nickname\u2026 Not as much as I mind the people at least.\u201d\n\nMy awe quickly turned to shame, but Spacegirl didn\u2019t look upset\u2026 She just stared at me blankly like she so often did. No\u2026 not blankly. Her face might not have conveyed much emotion, but there was definitely some emotion there. \n\n  \u201cI wish\u2026 I wish I\u2019d been nicer to you, when we were younger.\u201d I said.\n\n  \u201cIs that why you\u2019re here right now?\u201d Spacegirl asked.\n\n  \u201cNo! I\u2026 I\u2019m here for the assignment. I mean\u2026 the art assignment. The portraits\u2026\u201d \n\nShe continued to stare. \n\n  \u201cDid you pick me because you felt bad for me?\u201d She asked. \n\n  \u201cNo! I just thought it would be cool to work with you.\u201d\n\nSpacegirl didn't react for a moment, but then she just nodded. \n\n  \u201cOkay.\u201d Her flat tone made it hard to know what she meant by that. She stood up and walked over to the portrait. \n\n  \u201cMom can drive you home if you need a ride.\u201d She said. I opened my mouth to say something else. I wanted to apologize, but I didn\u2019t know what.Had I offended her? Had I said something wrong?\n\n  \u201cAlright. Thanks.\u201d It was the only thing I could think of. \u201cSee you tomorrow.\u201d\n\nWith that, I left her.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI was almost afraid to see Spacegirl the next morning. I drifted through my classes that day until I reached art\u2026 and when I did, I wasn\u2019t expecting what I saw. She had clearly been up late\u2026 but what she\u2019d brought in stole my breath away.  \n\n\nIt was my portrait, but she\u2019d done more with it than I thought possible. She\u2019d painted over the sketch, turning me into something beautiful. Flowers bloomed around my brown hair and a crown of daisies, lilies and chrysanthemums adorned my head. The colors were so vivid, and I looked so at peace in it. Spacegirl was looking right at me as I came in, as if she was gauging my reaction. But all I could do was stare wide eyed and in awe. When I looked back at Spacegirl, she was smiling at me. Her project single handedly netted us an A on the project and got the privilege of being hung up outside of the art classroom. Of course I told her how much I loved it, and I remember the way she smiled when I did. I remember thinking that it was the cutest smile I'd ever seen.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy portrait was up for barely even a day before Sasha had to make a comment. I\u2019d been on my lunch, and had just gotten some fries from the cafeteria when she and Tanya ambushed me.\n\n  \u201cWhere\u2019s your flower crown, dyke.\u201d Sasha said, \n\n  \u201cLeave me alone.\u201d I said, brushing past them, but Sasha was out for blood.\n\n  \u201cI always knew you were a little dyke. But now you\u2019ve posted solid proof of it! We\u2019ve gone and cracked the case, haven\u2019t we? So what happened? Did you go to her house and lick her retarded little snatch? You must be a real good dyke because she went and drew that for you!\u201d\n\nI tried to walk away from her, but Sasha and Tanya just kept following me.\n\n  \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong? Am I not pretty enough for you Dyke?\u201d She snapped at me.\n\n  \u201cMaybe she only fucks retarded girls.\u201d Tanya said, \u201cI\u2019ll bet Spacegirl squealed like a pig when she came.\u201d\n\nI stopped dead in my tracks, and I heard Sasha stop behind me. I don\u2019t know what it was about what she\u2019d said that pissed me off so much. But those two had finally struck a nerve. I spun around, swinging my lunch tray as hard as I could. Fries were scattered everywhere, but although I was aiming for Tanya, I hit Sasha. She went down hard, and I\u2019m not sure if she was even still conscious when she hit the ground. Tanya was on me in an instant. She slammed me back against a wall, and kept me pinned. She had size and strength on me, and there wasn\u2019t a thing I could do to stop her. Several other students grabbed at us. A teacher finally got involved and all three of us got escorted to see the Principal. As we left the cafeteria, I saw Spacegirl in one of the halls, just staring at me.   \n\n\nNaturally I got a three day suspension, but Tanya and Sasha were fine. Both of them said they\u2019d just been walking and I attacked unprovoked. It was their word against mine. Sasha had a familiar shit eating grin on as she left the office with only a bruise on her forehead to show for her troubles, but there was a familiar look in her eyes. That same anger I\u2019d seen last time I\u2019d laid a hand on her\u2026 and something about it scared me.  \n\n\nWhen I came back to school, I realized that I had every reason to be afraid. My portrait was missing. I wondered if they\u2019d taken it down because I\u2019d attacked Sasha, but the truth was a lot worse.\n\n  \u201cSomeone took it.\u201d Spacegirl said. She was sitting in her usual spot in the library when I found her, sketching flowers in her notebook.\n\n  \u201cWhen?\u201d  \n   \u201cThe day after you hit Sasha\u2026 I don\u2019t think anyone\u2019s found it yet.\u201d\n\nShe didn\u2019t look up at me. Just stayed focused on her art. She didn\u2019t need to say it for me to know who she blamed. Who else would it be? I had half a mind to confront Sasha about it, but I didn\u2019t know if that would be a good idea or not. Sasha could easily just cry wolf. I wouldn\u2019t put it past her. In the end, it didn't matter.  \n\n\nBy the time I was headed to art class, the painting was back. But there had been some modifications made to it.\n\nThe words:\n\n***Retard Fucking Dyke***\n\nHad been painted across my portrait in bright red. I saw it from down the hall and could see some other students whispering amongst themselves beneath it. I didn\u2019t know what to say or do\u2026 But this felt like too much.  \n\n\nThe picture was taken down quickly\u2026 but the damage was done. Sasha had gotten her revenge, and it didn\u2019t stop with just the painting. Spacegirl looked different than when I\u2019d seen her in the library. She seemed uneasy, and her eyes were red like she\u2019d been crying.\n\n  \u201cI\u2019m sorry about the painting\u2026\u201d I said softly. She looked at me, before sighing.\n\n  \u201cI knew she\u2019d do something like that\u2026\u201d She said, \u201cI\u2019m so used to it by now, that it doesn\u2019t bother me anymore. I\u2019m sorry she wrote those things about you, though.\u201d\n\n  \u201cBut you worked hard on that.\u201d I said, \u201cI\u2019d be upset too.\u201d\n\nShe just shook her head.\n\n  \u201cThat\u2019s not it.\u201d She said. She reached into her pocket, pulling out a crumpled up piece of paper then slid it over to me. \n\nSlowly I uncrumpled the paper, and my eyes widened as I recognized what was on it.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t the same drawing\u2026 but it was close enough. It was a depiction of Spacegirl hanging herself, and me beside her. A caption read \u2018*Retard Dyke Wedding\u2019.*\n\n  \u201cThere were so many in my locker\u2026\u201d Spacegirl said.\n\n  \u201cThis is what she drew in your notebook\u2026 when I returned it to you\u2026 This is what I had to take out.\u201d\n\nSpacegirl looked down at the picture again, before averting her eyes. She didn\u2019t pay much attention during class. Instead of taking notes, she sketched in her notebook. I looked over a few times to see her drawing another Unicorn. This one seemed so similar to the one I\u2019d seen before. She must not have been quite happy with it though\u2026 When I looked back at her notebook, the Unicorn wasn\u2019t there anymore. She must have just erased it\u2026 but it seemed so clean. Like it hadn\u2019t been erased at all. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nTanya was following me on my walk home that evening. I didn\u2019t know what she had in mind, but I didn\u2019t want to put up with it. When I was in the middle of a small walking path that cut behind some of the houses on my street, I stopped and looked at Tanya as she kept approaching.\n\n  \u201cWhat do you want?\u201d I asked.\n\n  \u201cIt\u2019s a surprise.\u201d She said, \u201cSasha and I just want you to know how much we love Dykes in this town\u2026 Oops, I\u2019ve said too much.\u201d\n\nI wanted to hit her. Dear God I just wanted to hit her, but we both knew she could overpower me. Whatever Tanya had in mind\u2026 it wasn\u2019t anything good. She drew closer to me, unafraid of anything I\u2019d do.\n\n  \u201cCome on, Dyke. Go home.\u201d She said. \u201cLet\u2019s go check out your surprise.\u201d\n\nIn a sudden horrible moment, I realized that Tanya was threatening me. I also realized that I couldn\u2019t outrun her\u2026 I couldn\u2019t fight her off. I didn\u2019t really have much of a choice but to do as she asked. Slowly, I turned and walked towards my house, with Tanya at my heels. It wasn\u2019t far, and up ahead I could see Sasha sitting on a park bench. From a distance, I recognized the red gas can beside her, and I stopped dead in my tracks.\n\nTanya seized me by the arm and pulled me towards the bench. Sasha just watched with a wide, manic grin.\n\n  \u201cHey Jane.\u201d She said, \u201cHow\u2019s it going?\u201d\n\n  \u201cWhat the fuck is this?!\u201d\n\n  \u201cJust wanted to chat.\u201d Sasha said with a cold chuckle, \u201cYou think you can get away with pulling the shit you did the other day. No. You\u2019ve been treating me like garbage for years, and for what? Because of Spacegirl? You know who you\u2019re fucking choosing, right? Right? God\u2026 I hate that retard girl. But you know what? I hate you even more. Acting like you\u2019re better than me just because you feel bad for her.\u201d\n\n  \u201cYou\u2019re crazy.\u201d \n\nSasha just laughed.\n\n  \u201cI\u2019m not the one who clocked someone with a fucking tray just for a little bit of teasing. You\u2019re absolutely fucking psycho!\u201d\n\nOn the bench behind her, I saw the portrait that Spacegirl had painted of me. Sasha picked it up and tossed it in front of me, then picked up the gas can and dumped it onto the canvas.\n\n  \u201cYou wanna be a Dyke, I don\u2019t care. But I\u2019m not letting you and your retarded whore put your shit up! So say goodbye to your little project, slut!\u201d\n\nSasha reached into her pocket and took out a book of matches. Her grin widened, before suddenly vanishing outright as she looked at something behind us.   \n   \u201cWhat the hell?\u201d Tanya said, and I craned my neck to try and see what they were seeing. As for believing it\u2026 that was another story entirely.  \n\n\nStanding on the path behind us was a Unicorn\u2026 but the way it looked was all wrong. This was nothing like a regular horse. Its body was plain white and almost textureless save for the many thin blue lines that ran along its body. It looked like it had been cut out from a sheet of lined paper but\u2026 that was impossible\u2026 It had to be impossible. Neatly done grey lines defined the shape of the horse. In fact, the lines reminded me of the ones Spacegirl used. This Unicorn looked like it had walked out of one of her notebooks!\n\nTanya let me go and stumbled back a few steps, wide eyed as she stared at the advancing Unicorn. It let out an angry noise before charging straight for Tanya. She panicked and tried to run. In her desperation to escape, she bolted down the path. But she couldn\u2019t outrun the paper Unicorn. It lowered its head as it drew nearer to her, and in one swift movement, the horn pierced Tanya\u2019s back, impaling her straight through the chest. She screamed as she was hoisted off the ground and the Unicorn circled back to fix Sasha in a murderous glare.   \n\n\nTanya looked down at the massive spike sticking out of her, her eyes clearly wide with horror and her body twitching its last spasms as the life quickly drained from her. The Unicorn lowered its head to let her slide off of its horn and she hit the ground in a bundle of limbs.  \n\n\nSasha and I stared in silent horror as the Unicorn reared up on its hind legs and brought its hooves down upon Tanya\u2019s body. She didn\u2019t scream. She didn\u2019t fight. She simply lay there as she was trampled again and again. I can only hope she died quickly.  \n\n\nSasha dropped the unlit match and took a slow, terrified step back before toppling over. I stumbled back and looked down to see the portrait of me at her feet. But it had changed. That beautifully painted version of me was now leaning out of the canvas, invading the real world and clutching Sasha\u2019s leg tightly.\n\nStill with that look of contentment on her face, I watched as the Painted Me slowly slipped back into her panting, and she took Sasha\u2019s leg with her.\n\n  \u201cFUCK, FUCK, FUCK!\u201d\n\nSasha desperately swatted at the Painted Me, but she couldn\u2019t overpower it. She couldn\u2019t escape. Her nails tried to dig into the pavement as she was slowly dragged into the canvas. She looked at me in horror, silently begging for help but all I could do was stare back at her in silence.\n\n  \u201cJANE! JANE HELP! PLEASE! PLEASE!\"\n\nThe hands of the Painted Me reached up, seizing Sasha by the hair and forcing her down into the canvas. It was like watching something pull her underwater. One minute she was there, the next she was gone. I stood silent in the park, staring at the painting, then at the paper Unicorn. The Unicorn huffed before retreating off into the woods and then I was alone.  \n\n\nSlowly, I approached the painting and I looked down at it. It had changed and now it depicted Sasha, her mouth open in a horrified final scream. After some hesitation, I picked up the painting. I could return it to Spacegirl in the morning. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThey chalked Tanya\u2019s death up to an animal attack, and nobody ever found Sasha. I never asked Spacegirl about what I saw. I don\u2019t think even she knew the answer, although she certainly knew much more than I did.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHigh School was ten years ago though, and I\u2019ve chosen not to remember as much as I can. I\u2019ve got my own life to live now and I try not to ask so many questions. Sometimes I see paintings move, but I don\u2019t bother with a second glance and I never ask my wife about them. She doesn\u2019t like to talk about it and I won\u2019t ever force her. The painting of Sasha hangs in her studio at home, right beside the painting of her Father. Sometimes I look at it and I wonder if maybe things could have been different\u2026 but I don\u2019t feel too guilty about it. I wouldn\u2019t feel too guilty if I heard another story about a suspicious trampling or animal attack either but to my knowledge, there\u2019s been nothing of the sort. I guess I shouldn\u2019t be too surprised. I do my best to make sure nobody hurts my beautiful Spacegirl.", "comments": [{"id": "f2wbmkv", "author": "NOSjoker21", "body": "> *My unsubtle message, this subtextual jazz.*  \n>  \n>*Is take your apology and stuff it up your ass.*\n\nYIKES.

As a former awkward, lonely kid who found solace in drawing, your story did strike a nerve OP. Many stories use bullying as a way to move the plot, but yours goes a bit further. \n\nI particularly appreciated the way you described your own \"go with the flow\" attitude (at first). The vast majority of my bullies weren't little sociopaths. They were perfectly normal kids who acted extra-shitty to me for the longest time, because that served their own social lives. Remembering that bullying is a pretty \"natural\", socially accepted behavior helps you keep your actions in check. It also helps you remember that this doesn't make you an irremediably bad person if you do ; just that you need to correct your behavior asap.\n\nBullying gets more attention these days, and that is SO necessary. But from my personal experience, I can't think of any solution implemented by adults that would actually work. Inclusion has to come from your peers - and, of course, as you described, that's not easily done. Whoever sides ever so slightly with the bullied kid risks loosing their own social status. \n\nI have to tell you though, inclusion does make all the difference in the world. It really, really does. \n\nIt wasn't before the last year of high school that I met my first friend. At first, she had to go out of her way for me to open up, and I don't think she even truly realizes how her doing so changed my life. She helped me gain confidence I terribly lacked, just in time. Fifteen years later, I have built a loving, diverse, evolving group of friends - I could never have imagined that when I was at school. Last year, my first friend was a bridesmaid in my wedding.\n\nAlso, there are still people around you who need you to start including them. In my early twenties, when I was finishing university, I met an awkward girl at a party. She was a bit isolated too, had some elocution issues, and clearly had a hard time connecting with people. Even I felt awkward around her - and boy do I have a high tolerance. But she is intelligent, and curious, and fierce and sassy in her own way, and very loyal. I decided to invite her to my own parties. \n\nI didn't do it because I felt bad for her, or because I expected some good karma or anything. Despite the awkwardness, I genuinely enjoyed her company, even then. I could just tell that she needed a little support. \n\nMy friends were a bit standoffish for a while. But, a few years later, people really connected with her. She truly has bloomed too - she is so much more confident and joyful than when I first met her !! Of course, I would never dream to take credit for her \"transformation\" - that all her. But I do hope that I gave her a nudge when she needed it. And, you know what, just one year ago, she was diagnosed as partly deaf. The whole time, part of her communication troubles were because she was reading on people's lips, and she herself wasn't completely aware of it. She has a brother with a severe case of autism, and I guess her parents didn't realize that she needed special attention, too.\n\nAnyway, thanks for your story OP. I'm just going to end with this : you might want to talk to your wife about her revenge fantasies. Her dad and Sarah's actions were f\\*\\*\\*ed up, but you can't fight fire with fire. The unicorn murders and drawing traps are pretty psycho too. All I'm saying is, understanding and sincerely forgiving my bullies was absolutely determining for my mental health.
