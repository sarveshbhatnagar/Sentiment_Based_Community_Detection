Once the postman had left and I was alone with my thoughts they just continued to get louder. \n\nI thought about Natalia and the cult. About the kids and their nighttime antics. About the committee meeting. Jamie and how much I missed him, Georgia and my burning guilt and Mr Prentice, who was finally making those aforementioned animal noises.\n\nMost of all I thought about the note left for me on move in day. How it had changed everything. My whole life was different now, I was alone and it felt like my new home was attacking from every angle. \n\nI re read the note a few times over my coffee. I worried about my rent, it was tight but manageable. School is currently out in the uk but as a training teacher assigned to a school I still get paid a small amount through the summer. The rent is low and with a second summer job I can just about make it without Jamie. \n\nIt sounds strange. But it felt nice to worry about something normal for a minute; even if I should have been worrying about my survival and the many entities currently trying to kill me. \n\nI didn\u2019t get to stew for too long, I had to get ready for the committee meeting. After the events of the night before and my growing mistrust of prudence it was imperative that I got the neighbours on side if I was going to achieve anything like my goals of eradicating the imposter/cultist neighbours. \n\nThe meeting was at noon in flat 31, there was a poster on a communal notice board by the entrance that I was glad to spot, Terri hadn\u2019t mentioned the time when we met and all our meetings since had been a bit hectic to discuss it. The poster promised tea and cakes and my stomach rumbled at the thought, I hadn\u2019t eaten properly in days.  \n\nAt 11.55 I left the flat, and wandered out into the corridor. I\u2019d never seen so many neighbours. Mr Prentice, however, was still making that awful noise and I watched in disbelief as every single person in the corridor walked past his door as if it was silent. \n\nI did my usual deliberation on whether to take the stairs or lift but yet again the stairs won. I still couldn\u2019t bear being where Jamie died and all these extra flights were keeping me fit.\n\nFlat 31 belonged to an older lady named Molly Thompson and her husband Eric. She had a blue rinsed head of curls attached to her head and had gone to the effort to make homemade batten-burg cake. Other neighbours had bought along baked goods as well. It reminded me of a school fair.\n\nThe flat itself was decorated for the 70s, with plenty of china cat ornaments littered around. I sat down on a dusty plastic garden chair, one of many that Molly seemed to have acquired and laid out for the residents pouring in. I hadn\u2019t seen community spirit like this in my life. \n\nI smiled as I saw Terri, Eddie and Ellie wander in. It was nice to see some familiar faces. I had noticed people looking at me, wondering who I was. It probably wasn\u2019t often they got new neighbours. Eddie came running up to me, swung his arms round me and sat down in the rickety garden chair next to mine. It was so sweet. Terri smiled at me and took a seat the other side of mine, Ellie sat next to her brother. The brown puppy dog eyes were back. No claws.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m glad you came!\u201d Terri said to me, loud enough to hear over the voices of the other neighbours. \u201cI really want you to see the good side of the block. We don\u2019t bite really!\u201d She laughed nervously as she realised the irony of her statement. \n\n\u201cTerri I need help, we need to stop those people from coming back again and from terrorising people. The block can\u2019t go on like this.\u201d I wanted to make the purpose of my attendance clear to her, it was time for things to change. \n\n\u201cBut if you don\u2019t let them in then they don\u2019t bother you. I\u2019ve spoken to the kids, they know not to do it again, that those people are dangerous.\u201d She paused for a moment and sighed. \u201cAlthough them running away didn\u2019t help, the kids think they\u2019re indestructible now. They\u2019ve been telling me all morning that they\u2019re going to kill the bad guys.\u201d \n\nShe looked so resigned. But it was true, they did run away from the twins. Maybe there was something in that, I knew they could die I just had to work out how. But as the thought crossed my mind and I looked at Eddie and Ellie, I couldn\u2019t imagine taking the risk.\n\nI could\u2019ve flat out gone back and asked Prudence. But to be honest I didn\u2019t want anything to do with her. She gave me such a bad feeling. I was doubting everything she told me.\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter if you can keep them away. We can\u2019t all live in fear. Yours aren\u2019t the only kids in this building.\u201d I knew this from surveying the room. \u201cBut I bet not all the kids here are as ... special ... as yours. What if another family burns to death because their kids were hyper one night.\u201d\n\nI could see this struck a chord with Terri. She looked at me with glassy eyes as if on the verge of tears. \n\n\u201cYou\u2019re right. Molly\u2019s the chairwoman and she can be a little strict but you can bring it up under any other business.\u201d She spoke with a lump in her throat. \u201cHere you go by the way.\u201d She handed me a piece of printed paper. \n\nAny other business felt a bit lacklustre but it would do. As long as it got discussed. \n\nI turned my attention the the piece of paper, it was the agenda for the meeting. For something written so formally it appeared farcical. It seemed other flats and floors had different but equally strange issues to mine. \n\nThere were only 6 items on the agenda for the meeting with AOB as the 7th. They were as follows. \n\n*1. Welcome and introductions with apologies for absence.*\n\n*2. Replacing of the flickering lights on floor 11, it seems to incite vicious behaviour from the pets and elderly of that floor.*\n\n*3. Serving a formal residents letter of concern to the man who doesn\u2019t move from the bottom of the stairwell on floor 5.*\n\n*4. Finances - budgets for general maintenance and the annual barbecue.*\n\n*5. The stairs with no grip leading up to floor 14 at the very top and the health and safety hazards this presents.*\n\n*6. Soundproofing of Mr Prentice\u2019s flat, number 48.*\n\nI was comforted to know that I wasn\u2019t alone in dealing with all these strange occurrences. I was also chilled to the core to know for certain that it was the entire building that was more than a bit odd. \n\nWhat really struck me as odd is that when I thought about it, I had seen that man on floor 5 when going down the stairs. But I\u2019d never noticed that it had been every time, or that he had never moved, until this moment. \n\nThe meeting begun with a loud and dissatisfying clink. \n\nBy this point the tiny, 70s themed flat was packed. Garden chairs had all ran out and people were standing. Molly Thompson stood up from her floral patterned arm chair and bashed a teaspoon against the outside of her cup. \n\nShe reminded me of a very strict, disciplinarian school teacher I had worked with during my university placement. She commanded quiet in the room. \n\n\u201cI think we should get started everyone!\u201d She shrilled, her voice growing louder with every word until the crowd came to a silent hum.\n\n\u201cRight, firstly, we are not going to skip the introductions today. Apologies have been given by Jo and Steph of flat 2 and yet again by Mr Prentice. We have a new face in the room as I\u2019m sure many of you have noticed.\u201d She gestured to me and looked in my direction but didn\u2019t really make any eye contact. She was just talking about me as I sat in the room. Eventually she addressed me directly. \n\n\u201cStand up dear, introduce yourself. We\u2019re pleased to have you here.\u201d\n\nI was deeply uncomfortable. I could feel some sort of panic coming on. I never liked standing in crowds very much. But I stood up anyway. \n\n\u201cErmm, hi. My name is Kat. I live in flat number 42, I moved in with my boyfriend Jamie but he was killed in the lift by the weird rat creatures you people have living here. The people that claim to live in the burned out flats won\u2019t leave me alone and one in particular seems to want me dead. Oh, and that window cleaner outside my flat makes me want to scoop my own eyes out with a spoon every time he knocks on the door. Nice to meet you all.\u201d The crowd had gasped a little.\n\nI sat down. Instantly mortified, I don\u2019t know what happened, the normality and structure of the meeting overwhelmed me. There\u2019s something about a sense of order and normality amongst chaos. It does something to your brain, and for me, for the first time in this whole journey, it sent me into a meltdown. \n\nI sobbed as I hit the chair, both in pure mental exhaustion and disappointment that I had blown my chance at building any sort of army against Natalia. Terri rubbed my shoulder. Molly broke the awkward silence that had blanketed the room. \n\n\u201cNice to meet you Katherine, I understand life in this building can be a little overwhelming. We did ask the previous occupant to let us intervene when you moved in but she was insistent. In hindsight we may need to review our policies on new tenants. I am so very sorry for the loss of your partner. The lift is a most unfortunate situation.\u201d\n\nShe had been in positions of power in her life for certain, she responded professionally but coldly, there was no feeling in her condolences. She came off like a corrupt politician digging themselves out of a hole. She did decide to skip the introductions after my outburst.\n\nI also hate it when I\u2019m called Katherine. My parents named me Katie and I shorten it to Kat. Her presuming it was Katherine added to her school teacher demeanour. \n\nShe carried on with the proceedings pretty swiftly and interesting characters present at the meeting started to emerge. \n\nMy favourite was a large middle aged Caribbean woman named Precious St Fluer who would not accept Molly\u2019s claims that there was not enough in the budget to replace the lighting on floor 11.  \n\nShe got up and lifted her shirt to reveal a large deep bite mark across her stomach caused by her dog after a long episode of the lights flickering. When that didn\u2019t change Molly\u2019s answer she lifted her trouser leg to reveal a smaller, but still noteworthy bite mark on her leg, from her elderly mother who lives with her. Molly didn\u2019t budge.\n\nIt took what felt like an eternity to get to any other business. If I weren\u2019t so focused on my goal I would have enjoyed hearing about the quirks of the other floors, maybe tried to engage a little, but I just couldn\u2019t concentrate. \n\nWhen the chairwoman asked if anyone had any other business she scanned the room quickly. I stood up from my chair and she locked in on me with her eyes. \n\nMy hands were shaking and I could feel a cold sweat forming all over my body.\n\n\u201cKatherine, what can we help you with dear?\u201d She asked in a patronising tone. \n\n\u201cI want help in getting rid of the people pretending to be from the burned out flats. I can\u2019t be the only person that doesn\u2019t like living in fear.\u201d I stated boldly, trying not to break down again.\n\n\u201cDear we have had this discussion multiple times and it\u2019s been taken off the agenda. I am aware you\u2019re new here but there is nothing we can do about certain problems within this building and for this particular issue we would appreciate you not letting them into your home and ignoring them like the rest of us.\u201d She snapped back. \n\n\u201cBut that\u2019s not good enough! Terri\u2019s kids answered the door last night, they\u2019re children, it\u2019s easily done, what if someone else\u2019s child does it and aren\u2019t so lucky to survive. One burned my friend so bad a few nights ago that she\u2019s still unconscious in hospital.\u201d This I knew from social media. \n\nA few people called out in agreement with me from the crowd. \n\n\u201cThe only one who has ever been able to deal with them is Prudence. And that difficult woman never revealed her methods. Don\u2019t think we didn\u2019t try. You\u2019re suggesting a suicide mission. You\u2019d do well to remember you are new here.\u201d Molly hissed through her teeth. \n\nDid she have to mention I was new so many times. It was grating on me. \n\n\u201cWell I\u2019m willing!\u201d Shouted Precious. She seemed stronger than the rest in her earlier rant. I was glad to have her on side. \n\nWhere she came forward, a few others followed. Soon I had 5 people plus myself willing to form a sub committee to get rid of the cultists. Molly didn\u2019t like it but she agreed to let us do it.\n\nThere was me, Precious and Terri along with lady named Shanti who lived a few doors from me. \n\nA man named Anton and his friend Leo from floor 8 made up the group. To be honest they just seemed keen to get involved with any kind of battle. Leo was the loud one, Anton was mostly silent. \n\nI invited them to my flat after Molly swiftly adjourned the meeting. Inviting anyone into my home made me anxious now. I found myself studying each of their faces to ensure they\u2019re weren\u2019t too average and I hadn\u2019t invited the wrong people in. I was fairly certain I hadn\u2019t. Eddie and Ellie settled in front of my tv in the bedroom so they didn\u2019t hear our conversation. They may only be kids but I felt safer with them there. \n\nWe discussed for hours how we could bring the imposter people into one place and kill them all. \n\nLeo was particularly creative, he came up with weird and whacky ways to end them; from locking them in a room and blasting with fire extinguishers until they freeze, to herding them into the lift between 1.11 and 3.33 am.\n\nThe whole time I waited nervously for a knock on the door, for them to come for us. But they didn\u2019t. We got time to plan. But despite the time it never really took off, no idea seemed feasible. \n\nI shared everything I knew. My conversation with Prue, the night before in Terri\u2019s flat... everything. Precious listened to my tales intently before speaking.\n\n\u201cDerek would have helped us. He was a great man, he used to turn up at my door in the dead of the night just as those lights started and take my dog for a walk.\u201d She spoke of the gardener with a fondness. \n\n\u201cPrudence told me about Derek. She said he\u2019s been gone since the garden was demolished.\u201d I replied flatly. \n\n\u201cIt was awful when he left. That woman that used to live here was nasty to him. I watched out my window as she tore up the garden. I know she was grieving for that little girl but I know Derek only ever wanted to help.\u201d Shanti spoke up from the corner. She had been pretty quiet the whole time. \u201cHe was the whole reason we don\u2019t have those awful creatures from the lift all over our homes anymore. My brother was killed by one before the agreement. He was 4 years old.\u201d\n\nI twitched as she told her story. Shanti has such sad eyes and speaking about her brother only filled them further with sadness.\n\n\u201cThis is another thing I don\u2019t understand. Why have any agreement, if you managed to kill most of them, why not all?\u201d I asked, feeling anger over Jamie burn through my throat as I spoke. \n\nPrecious laughed. Terri shot her a look from across the room. \n\n\u201cNo ones told you the whole story have they?\u201d Shanti asked, a single tear running down her face. \n\n\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d This was driving me insane, nothing was simple, how could I trust anyone. \n\n\u201cWhen Prudence and some of the others killed the creatures they killed a large group of them in one hit. They had started to work out that food scraps and pet food were attracting them and they gathered all the pet food in the tower block into one empty flat on the floor the fire had happened. They creatures came in droves just like expected and they set the flat alight. Again.\n\n\u201cThe flat was burned to ash on top of preexisting ash. Nothing could survive that.\u201d Shanti was interrupted after this by Leo. \n\n\u201cAnd then 3 giant rat motherfuckers literally rose from the ashes, triple as smart and strong and fucked shit up!\u201d He said, a look of excitement on his face. \n\nShanti rolled her eyes and continued. \u201cSo all Prudence did was cause a quite literally bigger problem. She didn\u2019t kill them, all she did was help them evolve.\n\n\u201cThere was only three of them but they learned to sneak attack. More people died than during the original infestation. They were more intelligent but not in the way it comes across when the agreements spoken about. We couldn\u2019t speak to or reason with them.\u201d\n\nTerri was looking at the floor. \n\n\u201cOnly Derek was able to do that, he spoke to them like he spoke to the garden. He made it safe for everyone again, I wasn\u2019t there. I was too young but there we were told he didn\u2019t even have to use words. They understood just a series of movements and eye contact. \n\n\u201cDerek explained the rule with the lift. He told us it was a gesture of goodwill. The creatures needed a home and seemed attracted to the building and we would let them live there and stop killing their kind if they would stop killing ours. But to show them some respect we would allow them a small time frame where unleash their instinctual nature. But only if someone came to them.\n\n\u201cThere are only 2 left now. Prudence killed the other during what happened with her granddaughter. But that only made them 2 stronger. Like they absorbed the 3rd.\u201d \n\nI tried to take in all the information I was receiving but I couldn\u2019t. It was too much. \n\n\u201cDerek isn\u2019t coming back, it\u2019s been years, this is pointless!\u201d Terri finally erupted. Precious laughed again.\n\n\u201cHow do you know?! You speak to dear old Prue all the time, know something we don\u2019t?\u201d Precious spoke sarcastically but I think she meant what she said. It was becoming clear that Prudence Hemmings wasn\u2019t too popular in this building. \n\n\u201cI don\u2019t speak to her all the time! We just keep in contact, she was always nice to me!\u201d Terri tried weakly to defend herself.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s because you\u2019re naive and a pushover! She used you because no one else would give her the time of day!\u201d Precious was about to launch into a full rant on Terri. I was glad Eddie and Ellie were in the other room and couldn\u2019t hear. I wondered if she\u2019d seen them at night. \n\nI decided to stop the rant. This was becoming counter productive and we were getting nowhere with our plans. I interjected and told them all I needed them to leave so that I could sleep. Partly true, although I knew I couldn\u2019t sleep. I had other things to do. \n\nThey all filed out of my flat, Terri and the kids were the last to leave. She gave me a hug as she left and told me to get a proper nights rest, telling me she was always there for a cuppa and a chat. It was sweet. I felt sorry for Terri. The kids hugged me too as they left. \n\nI know she spoke to Prue, but I was certain that it really was entirely innocent. \n\nI sat in the empty flat disheartened that my assembling of an army had turned into a bickering shit show with no real suggestions on how to kill the imposter neighbours. \n\nI felt totally alone. I couldn\u2019t trust Prue or Ian or pretty much anything I thought I knew. Maybe Prue didn\u2019t even kill those neighbours. They only told me half truths about the creatures after all. \n\nI was left alone with my thoughts again. And after a few hours, a good one finally struck me, but I needed supplies.\n\nI left the building and went to the nearest shop to gather the items I needed. For what I needed and the time of night I had to travel to a 24 hour supermarket. It took half hour each way on the bus. But I stayed focused. My bags were heavy and awkward on the way back to the block but if it paid off this was going to be worth it. \n\nI trudged up the stairs. It took me 2 trips and 24 flights of stairs instead of 14 to get everything in my flat and organise myself. \n\nIt only took 16 and a large gym bag that was much easier to carry on the way back down, thankfully. \n\nI passed the man on floor 5 twice. Now I\u2019d noticed him, he made my skin crawl a little. \n\nI walked through the downstairs corridor, diverting away from the main entrance and passing all the ground floor flats to the door at the back of the building.\n\nThe door at the back lead to a small concrete area with a grass strip along the side and a bench decorated with a memorial plaque. This was the blocks outside space. As is typical in the city the whole bench was covered in graffiti. The memorial was unreadable. \n\nI got to work. I dug the strip of grass, turning soil with my new equipment. I had never been green fingered and to be honest the shrubs I had bought had been so heavy I had grown to resent them a little. I worked for an hour and a half. I was sweating and night had come, it was pitch black and I was using my phone torch to see. \n\nI had almost given up until I got up from my crouching position to stretch my knees. I reached my arms out, put down my shovel and took a seat on the bench. \n\nI hadn\u2019t seen him arrive but the man was already sat there. He wore a flat cap and a jacket, despite it being the middle of summer and a beautiful night. He just smiled warmly at the shrubs for a moment without a word. Eventually he spoke. \n\n\u201cI\u2019ve missed this place. Names Derek.\u201d\n\nOur journey: https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/clvga9/the_previous_tenant_of_my_new_flat_left_a/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app", "comments": [{"id": "evr5b3g", "author": "NoSleepAutoBot", "body": "It looks like there may be more to this story.

Another is \"one who weakened or impoverished another\". Prudence is \"good judgement\". Katie is \"pure\", but also links to a word meaning \"to purge or cleanse\" - whereas Katherine can be \"martyr\". Derek is \"gifted ruler\". Precious is \"of great worth\". Anton is \"priceless\".
