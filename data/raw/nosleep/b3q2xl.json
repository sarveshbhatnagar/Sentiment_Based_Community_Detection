She didn\u2019t flinch, which meant she thought I had a lot to offer. \n\nPretty little thing, she was. Nearly thirty years old, though I\u2019d estimate the age of her modified chest to be about three. Her good looks stemmed mainly from the fact that she\u2019d clearly avoided a lifetime of hard work. I probably would have been equally attractive twenty-five years ago had my twin passions been vanity and stupidity.\n\nThis gal was taken care of.\n\nHer expression glazed for just a moment. I noticed.\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d she offered timidly, \u201cit\u2019s nothing like that.\u201d She looked up at me with wide eyes that had been conditioned to elicit sympathy. I noticed. \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just\u2026\u201d she bit her lip. \u201cIt\u2019s just that Raymond\u2019s been gone a month \u2013 but I don\u2019t think that he\u2019s *gone* gone, you know? I want to know if I should put him behind me, or\u2026\u201d She shed a tear. \u201cIt started out small. His favorite sweater would be hanging in the closet, but the next morning, it was lying on the bedroom floor. Not a big deal, you know?\u201d She looked around conspiratorially, despite the fact that no one was in the brightly lit sun porch besides the two of us. \n\nAs if sensing my thought, Sophocles rubbed up against my skirt. I reached down and scratched his ear without turning away from my client. She stared right back at me, looking over the swirling vapor dancing from the teapot\u2019s spout. \n\n\u201cBut then,\u201d she breathed, flushing slightly pink, \u201cI would be, ah, in an intimate moment-\u201d\n\n\u201cMasturbating, or fucking?\u201d I asked bluntly.\n\nHer pink face quickly turned crimson. \u201cUm, the first one. I\u2019d hear a sudden banging on my bedroom door. It would go away whenever I stopped\u2026 what I was doing.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat makes you think it\u2019s your dead husband?\u201d I pressed her, crushing my cigarette and lighting a new one.\n\nShe gazed down at the table. \u201cHe would *always* interrupt me. Even if it wasn\u2019t\u2026 about anything naughty.\u201d She looked up at me in desperation. \u201cIt just *feels* like him. Does that make any sense?\u201d She bit her lip again. I noticed. \u201cBut the worst thing was last night. That\u2019s what made me decide that it was time to talk with a\u2026 *professional.*\u201d\n\nGod, her little pauses and cute blushing were irritating. I really wanted to slap her. \n\n\u201cExplain,\u201d I ordered cavalierly before taking in that first drag.\n\nA long pull of the cigarette really makes people like her worth it. What was her name? Cindy? She seemed like a Cindy. But the Cindys of the world always scatter from my mind for *just* a few seconds during that first sensual puff. In those moments, I feel so *capable.*\n\n\u201cLast night-\u201d\n\nI coughed. Reality set back in. \u201cListen, Cindy-\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s Anne-Samantha.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou must have jilled off thousands of times in your life-\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry\u2026 \u2018jilled\u2019?\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, are you a Jack from the waist down?\u201d\n\nShe laid a dainty little hand right on her mouth. \u201cOh\u2026 my, no. I\u2019m all Jill, I suppose.\u201d\n\nI grunted. \u201cSo what\u2019s so different about jilling off now?\u201d\n\nHer eyes got wide again, but I had learned long ago to suppress the slap-urge. \u201cWhen I\u2019m alone in bed, I hear breathing. *Only* when I\u2019m alone. It\u2019s unmistakable.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, how hard are you working?\u201d I asked pointedly.\n\nShe dropped the hand from her face. \u201cThe breathing is coming from the other side of the room.\u201d\n\nI gave her an unblinking, fixed stare. She returned it.\n\nI finally turned away when a lump of ash fell from my cigarette onto the table. \u201cHere,\u201d I offered, pouring a cup of tea from the pot. I rested my hand on the painted grapefruit and lavender design to hold it steady. \u201cDrink this.\u201d\n\nShe took it obediently, blew on it, then took a sip and winced. \u201cToo hot?\u201d I asked sharply.\n\n\u201cToo bitter,\u201d she responded coolly.\n\n\u201cToo bad,\u201d I finished. \u201cDrink the whole cup if you want to see what\u2019s on the other side.\u201d\n\nShe sipped as I spoke. \u201cYou\u2019ve told me that Raymond\u2019s been gone a month. You\u2019re brokenhearted, but you can\u2019t move on if he\u2019s still here. The shock was terrible, wasn\u2019t it? A hit-and-run while he was crossing the street right in front of your own home. The worst moments of your life were sprinting through the house, knowing what was outside before you saw it. The hope was the worst, because you *knew* that your husband\u2019s broken body would be lying in the street. But the smallest part of you hoped that it wasn\u2019t true, and that *hope* made it hurt so much more. You found him in a gory heap just beyond your front yard, and the future you\u2019d imagined drained away like blood through your fingers. And it was in that exact moment, kneeling in the middle of the street at 7:13 p. m., that you realized your life had been permanently changed to a different path of someone else\u2019s choosing.\u201d I took an aggressive puff of the cigarette and pressed forward. \u201cThe sun set while you held his already-cooling hand, and you realized that this would be the first sunset you\u2019d spend knowing he was dead, and that you would end every day with this thought on your mind from now on.\u201d\n\nShe blanched. \u201cI never told you that it was at sunset. I never even said it was a car accident.\u201d\n\nI narrowed my eyes at her. \u201cThe guilt was more than you expected, because part of you had actually cared about Raymond. Yes, he was old, and *boring,* my God, you would never let him forget it. But he\u2019d felt just so fucking fragile when you crushed his spine with the car that the anger didn\u2019t seem to make sense in the moment.\u201d I blew smoke through my nostrils. \u201cHe knew it was you, Cindy. You pulled the car into the driveway and rinsed off the blood so fast that no one even thought to check it for evidence. But *he* knew, and as he lay dying, unable to speak through shattered lungs, he stared at you without hate, malice, or vengeance. It was simple confusion, Cindy. Raymond never considered that you did it for the cash. His dying thought was wondering how he\u2019d somehow been a bad husband, and he felt guilty for not knowing why.\u201d\n\nHer eyes were shimmering with tears that I believed were genuine, but I didn\u2019t give a shit.\n\nHer cup of tea was empty. \n\n\u201cI was so careful,\u201d she whispered in a pitch that was just below the \u2018only dogs can hear it\u2019 threshold. \n\nI rolled my eyes. \u201cNo you weren\u2019t, Sweetie. People are just stupid, and that\u2019s the only reason you\u2019ve gotten away with everything so far. Really, putting $619,138 cash in a briefcase is just *asking* for trouble.\u201d\n\nHer jaw hung in shock. \u201cHow could you possibly have known?\u201d\n\nI blew one last long stream of smoke from the cigarette. \u201cIf I were in your shoes, Sweetie, I\u2019d be much more worried about how much poisonous oleander you just had with your tea.\u201d\n\nShe slammed her hands on the table and grabbed the edges so hard that the empty cup rattled in its saucer. *\u201cWhat did you do to me?\u201d* \n\nI pulled the cigarette butt from my lips and quashed it in her empty cup. \u201cMake peace with whatever god or devil awaits your heart,\u201d I answered flatly. Then I turned to look across the sun porch at the ghost only I could see.\n\nRaymond was a disgusting mess. His shattered spine had no hope of holding his torso rigid, so every limp limb flopped at unholy angles. A fountain of black blood oozed from his white lips and nose. His intestines protruded from his stomach like ground beef squeezed between grimy fingers, and the coils hung to the ground like sausage links.\n\nHe stared at his young widow. \n\nOr, I should say, the one eye that hadn\u2019t popped to jelly was staring.\n\nI really think that Cindy would have been unnerved if she\u2019d known he was there. \n\nInstead, she focused on me. \u201cHow long\u2026 when will it start?\u201d She asked in utter petrification. \n\n\u201cIn just a second, Sweetie,\u201d I quipped casually, lighting up another cigarette.\n\nRaymond grunted. He wasn\u2019t much for talking, what with the lolling tongue dangling impotently where his missing jaw should have been.\n\n\u201cOh, and one last thing, Sugar.\u201d I leaned forward and gently rested my palms on the tabletop. \u201cRaymond wants to let you know that dying really, *really* fucking hurts.\u201d \n\nShe froze. Behind her, despite lacking a mouth, I could swear that Raymond was smiling.\n\nThe convulsing started then, but it didn\u2019t stop for a long time. \n\nDo you have any idea how far mouth foam can spray when a dying woman just won\u2019t stop thrashing?\n\nI almost felt bad for her when I realized how hard she was trying to cry. \n\nThat\u2019s a really fucking difficult task, though, when your throat is closing up. \n\nThat\u2019s when Raymond sauntered over to her jittering body, knelt down, and gently grazed his dead fingertips across her cheek. He looked passionately into her eyes, and for just a moment, I think she looked back.\n\nThen she was gone. \n\nThe ghost-corpse took in the sight for a few moments before I interrupted him with a forced clearing of my throat.\n\n\u201cA-*hem.*\u201d He glanced up at me with his lone functioning eye. It was damp. \u201cI *do* appreciate your clear instructions on how to locate the briefcase. If everything is as promised, the bill will be settled.\u201d\n\nHe grunted and waved his limp, floppy arm at the body of his dead wife. \n\n\u201cHer? I\u2019ll leave her in the backyard of your house. I snuck an oleander plant into the garden during one of my nightly visits. They\u2019re not uncommon here in Alabama, and they will explain her \u2018accidental\u2019 death nicely.\u201d I wrinkled my nose. \u201cAnd I have to say, I\u2019ll be grateful to stop sneaking into your house each night to spook this murderous little witch. Her masturbatory moans made me gag, and I hate crawling through windows. I\u2019m not fifty anymore, you know.\u201d I took in a deep breath of nicotine-laced air.\n\nHe grunted again, dangling his unresponsive arm above the dead woman once more. \n\n\u201cHmmm?\u201d I asked in genuine curiosity as I approached the corpse. \u201cThere\u2019s something more?\u201d\n\nHe shook more eagerly, spraying a fine mist of ghost blood onto the woman\u2019s purple face. \n\n\u201cOh, my,\u201d I whispered.\n\nI bent down and pried a ring from the woman\u2019s rubbery hand. \n\n\u201cThere must be two dozen diamonds on this!\u201d I sang. Then I slipped it onto my middle finger.\n\nIt fit perfectly. \n\n\u201cYes, thank you very much, I *do* accept tips for a job well done, you gentleman, you.\u201d\n\nThis time I *know* Raymond was smiling.\n\nAnd I was, too.\n\nMy name is Patricia Barnes, and I\u2019m a hitman for ghosts that [only I can see](https://www.facebook.com/P-F-McGrail-181784199029462/).\n\n[BD](https://www.reddit.com/r/ByfelsDisciple/)\n\n-----\n\n[What happened next](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/b59hoa/im_patricia_barnes_hitman_for_ghosts_that_only_i/?)", "comments": [{"id": "ej1a2g0", "author": "CassiopeiaFoon", "body": "This was utterly fantastic.
