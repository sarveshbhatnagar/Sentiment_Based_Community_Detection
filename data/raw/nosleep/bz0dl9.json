I\u2019ve been there myself several times. And it\u2019s nothing like what you see in games or horror movies. There are no ghosts, mutants or radioactive anomalies and death isn\u2019t waiting for you at every corner. Actually, I think it\u2019s one of the most peaceful and prettiest places on Earth. An example of strength of nature and how it can reverse the damage that we caused it.\n\nThus, when my friend Alexei decided to go there, he knew who to contact. He's a physics student and right now he\u2019s doing some kind of research on nuclear fallout and he said that he wanted to get some direct measurements and samples. But we both knew that it\u2019s just an excuse to go on an \u201cadventure\u201d. We visited the old powerplant, the abandoned city Pripyat and the surrounding exclusion zone. It was nice, but I would probably just bore you with more details. That part is not important anyway.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWe were driving on some dirt roads in a forest east of Pripyat when we found it. An old, rusty fence and a chained gate that blocked any further passage. There was a big sign with a radiation hazard symbol and captioned: \u201cRestricted area. Authorized personnel only\u201d.\n\nThere was a pair of massive metal blast doors in the side an artificially-looking hill not far behind the fence, with a large, white \u201cO-13\u201d painted on it and \u201cNO ENTRY\u201d sprayed on top.\n\n\u201cWhat do you think it is?\u201d Alex asked.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know, looks like some kind of bunker,\u201d I replied. \u201cAnd it looks like it has been closed for some time,\u201d I added after taking a closer look at the doors. The both halves were welded shut in the center. Alex took his samples and readings, but we were too puzzled to leave just yet.\n\n\u201cDo you think we can get in?\u201d I asked.\n\n\u201cWell not this way for sure. Even if it wasn\u2019t welded sealed, I\u2019m sure we have no way of unlocking it.\u201d Alex replied while examining the massive door.\n\n\u201cIt looks like an underground bunker. They must have had a way to pump air inside and I don\u2019t think this is it. There has to be another way to get in.\u201d I said.\n\nWe circled the main entrance to try find other means of entry. The day was already coming to an end and it was slowly getting darker. As we were searching, a thought crossed my mind.\n\nWhy would they weld the doors? What\u2019s so important inside that they went this far to keep people away?\n\n\u201cLook, there\u2019s something there,\u201d Alex pulled me away from my thoughts.\n\nIt was a concrete block a couple of meters large with what looked like vents on the sides. As I looked into the vents, I noticed that they were also sealed with heavy-looking steel hatches and no clear way to open them. However, there was also a somewhat smaller door labeled \u201cService tunnel\u201d with a large wheel on the outside.\n\n\u201cShould I open it?\u201d I asked.\n\n\u201cYeah, I\u2019m really wonder what this is. Anyway, we don\u2019t have to go in. At least we\u2019ll see if the door still works.\n\nAt first, the wheel wouldn\u2019t turn because of all the rust and dirt, but eventually it budged. The door unlocked. I pulled and it slowly started opening. It was very heavy and took a lot of force.\n\nBehind the door, there was a small platform and a tight vertical tunnel with a ladder. What caught my attention was that there was an identical locking mechanism on the inside. That meant that they could lock the door from both sides. But why? We were lucky, because if they had locked it from the inside too, there would be no way to get in.\n\nI stepped inside and shined my phone light down the shaft. It wasn\u2019t strong enough to hit the bottom. The air was damp and old and there was something that I couldn\u2019t identify. A very faint, chemical-like smell. There was no radiation nor signs of any other hazards.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got to be kidding me. This is so cool. We have to come back here and check it out later.\u201d Alex said.\n\nI couldn\u2019t agree more.\n\nIt was almost dark now, so we resealed the door and called it a day. But we promised ourselves to return.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI immediately tried to do some research when I got home, unfortunately with no success. I even tried to call Pavel, a friend of mine who knew the area better than me. Actually, it was him who brought me there for the first time. He couldn\u2019t help me either, but promised to ask around. I told him about our plan and asked if he wouldn\u2019t go with us, but unfortunately, he was out of the country for a while.\n\nA week later, we packed our gear and went on with it. We brought some rope, heavy flashlights, glowsticks, Geiger counters, waterproof protective clothes, an oxygen meter and a small emergency scuba tank just in case. And yeah, we\u2019re not stupid so we told our relatives and friends about our trip and when we\u2019re expecting to return.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWe closed the door behind us as we descended down the access shaft. We couldn\u2019t know what\u2019s down there and we didn\u2019t want to cause a radiation leak or something like that. We eventually dropped down into a concrete tunnel which enclosed the air vents and some smaller pipes. There was obviously no power and thus no lights. Good thing we brought our own.\n\nWe followed the tunnel and reached another door, but this time it was a regular one, not the heavy bunker-type. We went through and entered a room with 4 large air pumps and some electrical equipment and controls. The ventilation shafts split here into two larger ones that ran straight into ground and two smaller ones that went straight across the room where there was another set of doors.\n\nBehind the doors, there was a large hall with numerous boxes, crates and other cargo just laying around. There also was a security checkpoint. Behind the checkpoint, we found the main door that we have seen from the outside. Just next to it, there was some heavy lifting equipment. We returned through the checkpoint and taken a look at a set of elevators. There was a simple map with the layout of the facility floor by floor. We were on floor 0, main entry hall. There were another 4 floors below us.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFloor -1: Offices, security and recreation\n\nFloor -2: Secure laboratories\n\nFloor -3: Accelerator, Cleanroom decontamination chamber\n\nFloor -4: Experiment site\n\nThe map was titled \u201cObject-13\u201d. It wasn\u2019t a military bunker. This was a research site.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWe took a set of stairs, since the elevators were of no use without power. An unsettling thought brushed my mind as we were descending. They probably were moving some supplies, and then left them there and took the equipment to the main door. Were they trying to get out?\n\nI stepped on another stair step but something rolled away under my foot, lost my balance and fell on my back. My pack luckily absorbed the impact. I looked under my feet to see what caused my fall. Empty bullet casings.\n\nThis wasn\u2019t the sole reason why I felt odd about this place. As soon as we got down to level -1, I noticed that every single door was open. Every single one. There was a canteen and a kitchen right at the beginning of a long rectangular corridor. Various offices surrounded the corridor. There was the regular stuff \u2013 paperwork, old computers, personal belongings, all right there where they left it. Did they leave in a hurry?\n\n\u201cDimitri!\u201d Alex called from, the canteen on the opposite side of the corridor.\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d was all I could say when I followed him to the canteen.\n\nThere was food still neatly served on the tables. But it wasn\u2019t spoilt. It wasn\u2019t fresh either, but it wasn\u2019t decaying, as a 30-year-old meal should.\n\n\u201cHow is this possible?\u201d I asked.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know, maybe it was irradiated or something. But it\u2019s not anymore, I checked that. I really don\u2019t know man,\u201d he answered, as puzzled as I was.\n\nOh, why didn\u2019t we just turn back and leave? Now that I\u2019m writing this, there were so many red flags already. Something really wrong happened down there. But I guess we were too excited and curious. But it was at this point that my excitement started to fade and be replaced with an eerie feeling.\n\nNevertheless, we continued and descended down to level -2. The stairwell ended here, and to go deeper, we would have to cross the entire floor to reach an another one on the opposite side. There was a security checkpoint and a large blast door that we had to pass through to reach the labs. Again, every door was wide open. However, the things that people left here weren\u2019t neatly placed where they should have been. It was a mess everywhere. There were all kinds of rooms with all kinds of equipment that I didn\u2019t understand. Occasionally, there were more empty bullet casings on the ground. There still was the one central rectangular corridor as above, but the rooms around it were like a little maze.\n\nAlmost at the other side of the floor, we found the head scientist\u2019s office. As I said, everywhere it was a mess, but I found a logbook on the desk. There was only a handful of pages, the rest torn out.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**5. October 1984:** Today we successfully managed to translocate several atoms without changes in any physical properties. It\u2019s going to be a long road until we can transport solid objects, but we\u2019re going some good work here.\n\n**17. January 1985:** We\u2019ve managed to transport an apple today. However, I couldn\u2019t help but notice that the pattern of red and green skin on top was slightly different. But it was still the same apple, with the same structure, shape, everything. We also tried to transport some electronics. They were unharmed and in working order. I think that we still have a lot to perfect and learn about this technology, but we cannot slow down now. The country is relying on us.\n\n**21. February 1985:** After the animal trials, we translocated our first human today. He is alive and healthy, a brave hero of our nation. We have proven that this technology works now, but the practicality is still very limited due to the fixed translocation ratio. We still cannot \u201csend\u201d matter. Only exchange the positions of two equally massive objects. I have proposed a new type of device, that could possibly achieve one-way translocation of just a single object, but it would need an immense amount of energy.\n\n**1. May 1985:** Our superiors accepted my proposal. They are going to build a new, much bigger translocator here, in the power plant, so we can use a nuclear reactor as a direct power source. There is one more thing. We\u2019ve now translocated dozens of test subjects. Each one is alive and well, but sometimes they are a little bit, well, different. They sometimes claim that various events in the past happened differently than they really did. Sometimes they claim to know people who don\u2019t exist, or more alarming, they know people who they are not supposed to know. The following was written below with a pencil by hand: \u201cTest subject 28 was speaking an unknown language and couldn\u2019t understand any real language after the experiment.\u201d\n\nThere was a lot of missing pages afterwards.\n\n**25. April 1986:** We are going to try to change our approach. It\u2019s been more than a year, and we\u2019re still unsuccessful in eliminating the translocation symmetry anomaly. We still event don\u2019t know what is causing it, but we are not going to make any progress this way. Today, we are going to try to access the conduit reality instead.  Even though Unit 2 - the one we built in the power plant - is still new, we are going to use it for this experiment. Who knows what wonders are waiting for us on the other side?\n\nThere was one last page in the logbook. On it, it was just a single phrase, written again and again:\n\n# \u201cWE LET THEM IN\u201d\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\u201cAlex, I think we should go,\u201d I called.\n\n\u201cMan, come take a look at this,\u201d he answered.\n\nI stepped out of the lab and back into the hallway.\n\nThere were \u2026 clothes all over the corridor. Well what was left of them. They were torn to shreds. No bodies, no blood, just strips of cloth and an occasional shoe or a watch.  I looked up and stared down the dark corridor in front of us. I just stood there for a while.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt was, I don't know ... as if something torn all these people to shreds, and then cleaned it all up. Except the clothes and other non-organic material.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nA wave of pure, instinctive dread washed over me. I couldn\u2019t move. I didn\u2019t even breathe.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s just get out of here.\u201d Alex said.\n\nWe turned around and walked away. Slowly at first, but we quickened our pace. Our footsteps echoed across the underground structure.\n\n\u201cI just want to be out of here man. We shouldn\u2019t have done this\u201d Alex said. I didn\u2019t tell him about the logbook, but\u2026\n\nMy thoughts were cut short after a sudden realization.\n\nHis voice didn\u2019t echo. It was just our footsteps.\n\nI think he realized too, because we both stopped and listened.\n\nNothing. Just silence.\n\nI stepped forward.\n\n*Clack.*\n\nI took another step.\n\n*Clack.*\n\nThere was this door just in front of us and I forced myself to try something. I closed it behind us as we passed it and placed a glass beaker that I found on the ground on top.\n\nI took a step forward.\n\nSilence\n\nIt was just echo after all, I thought.\n\nWe walked away, carefully at first, but then we once again quickened our pace. We turned around a corner, and then it happened.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*Crash*\n\nThe glass shattered.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSomeone\n\nor some thing\n\n&#x200B;\n\njust opened the door.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWe dropped all our gear except our lights and ran as fast as we could. I didn\u2019t even know I could run this fast. I always tried to be a tough guy but I was never so scared in my life.\n\nOur footsteps didn\u2019t echo anymore. Or better said, they weren\u2019t in sync with ours anymore. Something was running after us. Each second it was getting closer. And closer.\n\nAs soon as we reached the security checkpoint, we started closing the door. The rusty joint of the door squealed in protest, but we pulled with all our strength. We almost had it closed, when we heard a loud, guttural and unnatural growl.\n\nThe door slammed shut and I threw the wheel to the \u2018locked\u2019 position. My heart was pounding so hard that it was all I heard for a while.\n\nNo, wait, it wasn\u2019t my heart. It was that thing, pounding on the locked blast door.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWe were running again. We reached the stairwell and run up, taking 2-3 steps at once.\n\nWe finally reached the air pump room. The ascent really exhausted us and even though I was scared shitless, I felt like I would pass out if I took another step forward. Besides, we locked it down there.\n\nAlex sat down and leaned his back on one of the large vertical vents with a bang.\n\n*Bang. Bang. Bang\u2026*\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOh fuck.\n\nWe locked it down there.\n\nBut we forgot the vents.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAlex and I looked at each other, our eyes met, and then\u2026 the vent burst and he was gone. I only heard him scream as he was dragged back down.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI feel terrible for doing this, but I just ran, I climbed the service shaft and locked the service door shut when I was finally out of this hell.\n\nAs soon as I had phone service again, my phone started beeping with loads and loads of missed calls and messages from Pavel.\n\n\u201cHey Dimitri, I found this guy, he says he knows what \u2018O-13\u2019 is. Please pick up as soon as you can, he says it\u2019s dangerous and you should stay out of it.\n\n\u201cThis guy is calling me now, he sounds serious, please call me back at once\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on but he\u2019s going there, please I hope you get this before you go down. Stay safe friend.\u201d\n\nThere was also one message from an unknown number:\n\n\u201cDimitri, this is Anatoliy Moroz, I know what you found and I\u2019m on my way from Kiev now. DO NOT GO DOWN THERE. If you already did and you manage to get out, lock the door that you used to get in and make sure it stays locked. I will try to call you when I\u2019m here.\u201d\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo here I am, writing this while I wait. I do this to make sure that no one else repeats our mistake, since I don\u2019t know if I\u2019ll live long to tell anyone personally.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI just can\u2019t leave Alex behind.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI have to go back.\n\n# [Part 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/c090ig/the_chernobyl_disaster_was_a_coverup_of_something/)", "comments": [{"id": "eqoi5v9", "author": "ValueNull", "body": "Darn Alex got zoinked by inter-dimensional ghosts"}, {"id": "eqoyzkl", "author": "Tetha", "body": "I'd advise you to leave.
